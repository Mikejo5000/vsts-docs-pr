# Visual Studio Marketplace Preview

The Visual Studio team is working on a brand new Visual Studio Marketplace, which is a new destination and the exclusive place for purchasing Visual Studio cloud subscriptions and discovering extensions for Visual Studio, Visual Studio Team Services, and Visual Studio Code. Once it is ready, all Visual Studio extensions will be migrated there from the Visual Studio Gallery. There will be no action required from you to migrate your extension. In the meantime, continue managing your extensions in the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/).

Take a look at the [Visual Studio Marketplace Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)

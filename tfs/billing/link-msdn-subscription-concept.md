# Why add work or school accounts to Visual Studio with MSDN subscriptions

**VSTS**


If you access your Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or Microsoft Azure account with a 
work or school account, but access your Visual Studio subscriptions with a different identity (such as your personal 
Microsoft account), you can link your work or school account to your Visual Studio subscription.

You need an [eligible Visual Studio subscription](../accounts/faq-add-delete-users.md#EligibleMSDNSubscriptions) that 
includes VSTS as a benefit so that other services (VSTS and Azure) can recognize you.

The Visual Studio subscriptions portal (```https://my.visualstudio.com```) requires you to sign-in with the email 
address that was used to access your subscription on the legacy MSDN portal, or the email address that was assigned 
to you by your company's Visual Studio subscriptions administrator after October 2016. This email address can be either 
your personal Microsoft account or a "work or school account" managed by your organization with Azure Active Directory.

If your Visual Studio subscription is accessed using your Microsoft account, and you're accessing other services (VSTS or Microsoft Azure) using your work or school account, you can link your personal account to your work or school account in order for the services to recognize you as a Visual Studio subscriber.

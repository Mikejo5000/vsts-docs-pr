### I use Team Foundation Server on-premises and I don't see some of these features. Why not?

Some of these features are available only on
[VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs)
and not yet available on-premises. Some features are available on-premises if you have
[upgraded to the latest version of TFS](../../tfs-server/upgrade/get-started.md).

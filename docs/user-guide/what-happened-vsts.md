# What happened to VSTS?

On September 5th, 2018, Visual Studio Team Services was rebranded as "Azure DevOps", a set of DevOps services and features under the Azure brand. The individual features of VSTS are now branded as separate services, as follows:

| VSTS feature        | Azure DevOps service |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Build & Release     | Azure Pipelines      |
| Code                | Azure Repos          |
| Work                | Azure Boards         |
| Test                | Azure Test Plans     |
| Package (extension) | Azure Artifacts      |

Each service can be acquired separately, or together as Azure DevOps Services. Since you are already a VSTS subscriber, you have access to all of the services.

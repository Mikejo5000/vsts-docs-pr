# Use VSTS with a screen reader 

VSTS strives to be an accessible product for all, but using the product can still be a challenge if you rely on a screen reader. If you use a screen reader, this article can help you understand how to use VSTS.

Here you will find guidance on the layout of all of our pages in general, common patterns for navigating the product, and more specific guidance on how to go through our most common scenarios. We hope you find this documentation useful and would always love to hear feedback on how we can improve this.
**VSTS**


**Navigating with landmarks**

There are three landmarks on every VSTS page:
- The first level navigation landmark that contains hubs like Code, Work, Test, and Dashboards
- The second level navigation landmark that contains hubs within each first level hub (work hub has backlogs hub and boards hub)
- The main landmark which contains most content in a page


**The layout of VSTS pages**

In general, all pages in VSTS have a common layout. At the very top of the page is the first level navigation section, with links to major hubs like Dashboards, Code, and Work on the top left. In addition there is a project/team picker to the left of these links. The project/team picker can be used to look at different teams boards or pull requests. On the right of this navigation section is a work item/code search input, as well as links to your profile settings, and a link to give feedback to VSTS.

Below the first level navigation setting is a second level navigation menu. Each of the major hubs has it's own second level navigation section with it's own links. The Work hub has the backlogs and queries hubs, the code hub has the files, pull requests, and branches hubs. 

Below both of these navigation sections is the main landmark of the page. This contains the main content for every page.

**The team picker**

VSTS is an application that enables teams to work better together. The experience is largely driven off the current team context, which is visible at the top left of the application. Depending on the current team, you will see different work items/kanban boards/pull requests. It is important to pick the team that you want to see work items for here before navigating to our other experiences.

**The Work Hub**

The work hub consists of four sections, Work Items, Boards, Backlogs, and Queries. Work Items contains groupings of work items that show you the most pressing work of the day. This section is useful for quickly finding work that is assigned to you, or has been recently created. The hub consists of a grid displaying a list of work items, with a set of filters at the top that you can use to change the work items being shown. Clicking on a work item in the grid will take you to the Work Item Form.

**The Work Item Form**

The work item form is probably the most commonly used piece of UI in VSTS, but it can be hard to understand and navigate for users with screen readers. At the top of the form is the title of the work item next to it's ID. Below this are a variety of controls that are used to edit the work items data. They may be editable, or they may be read-only, depending on the state of the work item and your permissions. At the top right of the form is the save button, along with a context menu with a list of items with further operations you can do on this work item.

The work item form is customizable, and may have a different structure depending on your projects process. Talk to your project administrator if you are having trouble understanding the work item form your team uses.

**Boards**

The Boards section contains a Kanban board

**Asking for feedback**

VSTS has made efforts to be accessible to screen readers, and we will detail our efforts below, but we are learning more every day about how to improve our application. Feedback from users is always appreciated, and will help us improve our product. To give us feedback, please find the "Report a problem" button, located at the top right of the application inside of the feedback menu item.

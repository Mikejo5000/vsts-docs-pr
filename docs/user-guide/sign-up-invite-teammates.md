# Sign up for a free VSTS account and invite others to join your team  
**VSTS**
 
Sign up for a [VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs) 
account to upload and share code in a free unlimited private 
Git repository. You can then connect to your favorite development tool like Eclipse, Xcode, 
Visual Studio, IntelliJ, or Android Studio to work on apps anytime, anywhere. 


<a name="MicrosoftAccount"></a>
##	Sign up with a personal Microsoft account

0.	Go to [VSTS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137&clcid=0x409). 
Enter your email address for your Microsoft account. 

	If you're a Visual Studio subscriber 
	and get VSTS as a benefit, 
	use the Microsoft account associated with your subscription.

0.	On the Microsoft account sign-in page, 
enter your email address for your Microsoft account. 
Then enter your password, and finish signing in.

	<img src="../accounts/_img/_shared/sign-in-msa2.png" alt="Enter password for your Microsoft account" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	If you don't have a Microsoft account, 
	you can create a Microsoft account at this time. 

0.	Name your  account. 
To manage your code, choose Git or Team Foundation Version Control.

	<img src="../accounts/_img/sign-up-visual-studio-team-services/create-team-services-account.png" alt="Name your VSTS account, choose your version control" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	Learn which version control ([Git](../git/overview.md) 
	or [Team Foundation Version Control](../tfvc/overview.md)) 
	works best for you.

0.	Confirm your account's location. 

	<img src="../accounts/_img/sign-up-visual-studio-team-services/check-account-location-standard.png" alt="Rename team project, change account location, or select another process" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />
	
	VSTS will create your first team project as "MyFirstProject" 
	and will use Agile as your default work item process to organize your work. 
	Choose **Change details** to 
	rename your team project, change the account location, or select another process, like Scrum.

0.	After VSTS creates your account and team project, 
you can invite others to join your project, add code, or start planning and tracking using work items.

	<img src="../accounts/_img/_shared/team-project-created.png" alt="Add code or work items" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

	Congratulations, you're now a VSTS account owner! 

	To sign in to your account at any time, go to ```https://{youraccount}.visualstudio.com```.

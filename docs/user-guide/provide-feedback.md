## Content feedback  

Help us improve our content by rating it and giving us feedback. 

&#160;&#160;&#160;*Can't find an answer you're looking for?*<br/> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;*Want more detailed examples?*<br/> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;*Want to know if a specific version is supported?* 

Use our content feedback channel to let us know (Is this page helpful?) located at the bottom-right of the page. This button appears for all topics under visualstudio.com/docs. If you're looking for an answer and you can't find it, let us know and we'll work to update the topic with an answer. Simply click Yes or /No to rate the topic and fill out the form. 

 <img src="../_img/provide-feedback-content-feedback.png" alt="Topic feedback form" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" /> 

About half of the feedback we get is product related. Customers want to know if a feature is supported, or they suggest a new feature. If that's what you want to do, we suggest you submit a request for a new feature through our [UserVoice channel](http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/330519-team-services), or ask a question in one of our [forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/home?forum=TFService) to learn if a feature is supported. 

### Print a topic 

You can print most topics using your browser's print function. Most of the latest browser versions for Edge  and Chrome provide various options to simplify the contents prior to printing. These browsers also support saving the topic as a pdf file.   
 
## Product feedback, report an issue  

You can provide feedback for any Visual Studio product at the [Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/). Or, from within Visual Studio, you can report a problem and review other trending issues. 

![Visual Studio, Report a problem](../_img/provide-feedback-report-problem.png)

To learn more about reporting a problem, see [Report a problem with Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio-2017)  
 
 
## Learn about the latest updates 

Every three weeks or so we update VSTS and provide a summary of new and updated features through our [Product features timeline](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/release-archive-vso). 

<a id="platform-version">  </a>
## Platforms and version support 

We add new features all the time, especially to our VSTS cloud offering. Later, most of these features make there way into our on-premises TFS product. To learn about whats new and coming, check out the [Features timeline pages](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/release-archive-vso). 

Our content supports both platforms&mdash;VSTS and TFS&mdash; and multiple versions of TFS. At the top of each topic, you'll see a platform/version heading to alert you as to which platforms and versions are supported. For example: 

<img src="../_img/provide-feedback-platform-version-header.png" alt="Topic platform-version header" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />  

In general, a feature is supported for all subsequent versions of TFS, unless specifically noted. Some topics include a link to previous versions which describe how the feature worked for an earlier version of TFS. 

If the platform-version heading is missing, and you're unsure of whether it's supported, click the Yes/No link and let us know through our content feedback channel. 
  
### What platform/version am I using? 

You can tell what platform you use from the URL you use to connect to VSTS or TFS. 

**VSTS**
A VSTS URL consists of an account name and visual studio.com, for example: ```https://{youraccount}.visualstudio.com```.  

To learn the version number, enter the following address in a web browser:     
```
https://AccountName.visualstudio.com/_home/About
```  
A page similar to the one shown will open showing the version number.  

<img src="../_img/version-team-services.png" alt="VSTS About page, version number" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />  


**TFS**  

A TFS URL consists of a server name and collection, for example: ```https://ServerName:8080/tfs/CollectionName```.  

To learn the version number, enter the following address in a web browser:
```
https://ServerName:8080/tfs/_home/About
```
A page similar to the one shown will open showing the version number.  

<img src="../_img/version-tfs.png" alt="TFS About page, version number" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />

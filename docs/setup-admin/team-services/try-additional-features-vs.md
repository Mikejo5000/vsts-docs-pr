#   Try paid extensions for free in Visual Studio Team Services

**Team Services**

Extensions offer features and capabilities that you 
can install in your Visual Studio Team Services account. 
Some paid extensions offer a trial so that you can try 
their features free for a limited time. 
For example, the [Test Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/ms.vss-testmanager-web) 
extension offers a free 30-day trial so that all 
users with access to Basic features can try the integrated, 
comprehensive manual and exploratory testing features. 

## Who can start extension trials?

As the Team Services [account owner or project collection administrator](#find-owner), 
you can start extension trials for your Team Services account. 
Otherwise, you can 
[request extensions](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/marketplace/get-vsts-extensions#request) 
instead. Learn about other 
[Team Services extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vsts).

##		Keep using your extension after the trial ends

Follow these steps *before* the trial ends if you want 
to keep using your extension without disruption. 
Otherwise, you'll lose access when the trial expires. 
Charges won't start until the trial ends. 

> [!TIP]
> You only have to buy and assign extensions for users who need access. 
> Some extensions include free users. To keep access to such extensions, 
> [assign the extension up to the number of free users that you get](../../marketplace/get-vsts-extensions.md#assign-extension). 
> For additional users who need access, 
> [buy the extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace](../../marketplace/get-vsts-extensions.md) 
> and [assign the extension to these users](../../marketplace/get-vsts-extensions.md#assign-extension). 
> If you have [Visual Studio subscribers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions), 
> check their subscription benefits. These users get additional features, 
> like Test Manager, included with their subscriptions as benefits. 
> So if you installed these extensions, Visual Studio subscribers 
> can continue using them without paid access and assignment.
> 
> To change the number of users that already have paid extension access, 
> learn [how to change that quantity here](../../marketplace/get-vsts-extensions.md#change-extension-quantity).

If you lose access because the trial expires, 
just follow these steps to buy and assign the 
extension for users who need access.

0.	[Buy the extension](../../marketplace/get-vsts-extensions.md#install-extension) 
only for users who need access.

	To buy the extension, you can also go to the extension pane in your account.	

	![Users hub, extension pane](_img/try-additional-features/extension-trial-in-account-updated-ui.png)

0.	[Assign the extension](../../marketplace/get-vsts-extensions.md#assign-extension) 
only to users who need access.

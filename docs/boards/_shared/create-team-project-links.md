Before you start tracking work, you must have a project. To create one hosted in the cloud, see [Sign up for VSTS](/../user-guide/sign-up-invite-teammates.md). To create one hosted on an on-premises TFS, see [Create a project](/vsts/organizations/projects/create-project.md).   

If you have a project, start tracking work:  

-   [Add work items to manage a project](/vsts/boards/backlogs/add-work-items.md) - to gain more familiarity with the work item form features  
-   [Create a backlog](/vsts/boards/backlogs/create-your-backlog.md) - to develop your product backlog   
-   [Plan a sprint](/vsts/boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint.md) - to start working in Scrum    
-   [Kanban](/vsts/boards/boards/kanban-basics.md)  - to start working in Kanban  
-   [Excel](/vsts/boards/backlogs/office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) or [Project](/vsts/boards/backlogs/office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md) - to create a work breakdown structure

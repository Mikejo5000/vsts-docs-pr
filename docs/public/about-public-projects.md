# What is a public project

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/version-public-projects.md)]

A public project is one that's available to everyone without logging in.
Anyone can see the code, work items, builds, releases, and more.
Non-members get a read-only view of these items; only members can make changes.
The most common use for a public project on VSTS is setting up a CI/CD pipeline for an open source project.

You can choose to make an existing project public, or you can create a new one.
We offer guidance on [making existing projects public](make-project-public.md).
When you choose to make a project public, all of its contents are included.
You cannot choose specific repositories, area paths, or build folders to keep private.

## Important notes about putting public and private projects in a single account

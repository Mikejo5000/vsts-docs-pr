# Default roles & access for public projects

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/version-public-projects.md)] 

Public projects enable users to view the contents of a project without being added to it as a member. These users are referred to as anonymous users, ones who aren't signed in. In addition, there are public users, ones who are signed in but not a member of a project. Both of these types of users are granted read-only access as indicated in the following chart.  

Stakeholders and regular contributors must be added to a team project and are managed in the same way as for a private project. To learn more, see [Add users to your account](../accounts/add-account-users-from-user-hub.md).

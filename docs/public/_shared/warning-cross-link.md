We offer cross-project linking features, such as linking a bug in Project A to a pull request in Project B.
If links exist between a public and a private project, details about the linked artifact in the private project are visible within the public project.
Five kinds of cross-project links expose content from the private project.

| Link type            | Exposed content         |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| TFVC                 | Project name, file name |
| Git branch           | Branch name             |
| Wiki page            | File name               |
| Pull request mention | Pull request title      |
| Work item            | Work item title         |

If a work item is moved from a private project into a public project, it has details about the private project stored in its history.

<!-- TODO: link to /accounts/invite-outside-users.md when it lands -->
When you invite a user to become a member of a project, that user also gains access to additional resources and details about the account.

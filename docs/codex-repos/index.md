# What is Codex Repos?

Codex Repos is one of several cloud service applications provided in the Azure Codex suite of applications.

From the **Code** hub you gain access to your source control Git-based or TFVC repositories to support version control of your software projects. These repositories are private.

From the Code hub for Git you can perform these tasks:

- Review, download, and edit files and review the change history for a file  
- Review and manage commits that have been pushed       
- Review, create, approve, comment, and complete pull requests  
- Add and manage Git tags   

To learn more, see the overviews for [Git](../git/overview.md) or [TFVC](../tfvc/overview.md).

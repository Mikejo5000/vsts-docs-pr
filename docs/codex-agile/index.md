# What is Codex Agile?

Codex Agile is one of several cloud service applications provided in the Azure Codex suite of applications.

From the **Work** hub you gain access to Agile tools to support planning and tracking work.

Specifically, Codex Agile enables you to perform these tasks:

- Add and update work items 
- Define work item queries and create status and trend charts based on those queries			
- Manage your product backlog   					
- Plan sprints using sprint backlogs 
- Review sprint tasks and update tasks through the task boards				
- Visualize the work flow and update status using Kanban boards	 				
- Manage portfolios by grouping stories under features and features under epics   

See [Backlogs, boards, and plans](../work/backlogs/backlogs-boards-plans.md) for an overview of each.

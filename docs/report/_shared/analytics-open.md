## Open Analytics to access views

After you install the Analytics Marketplace extension, a set of default Analytics views are created for each team project. You can view, modify, and create a custom view from **Analytics**. 

# [New navigation](#tab/new-nav)

From a web browser, expand **Overview** and choose **Analytics views**. 

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]  
> ![Open Analytics view, new navigation](/vsts/report/analytics/_img/open-analytics/open-analytics-views-vert.png)   

If you don't see the team or team project you want, choose the ![](/vsts/boards/_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to [browse all projects](/vsts/user-guide/account-home-pages).  

# [Previous navigation](#tab/previous-nav)

From a web browser, connect to your team project, choose  **Analytics**, and then **All**.  

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Analytics hub](/vsts/report/analytics/_img/editable-views/directory-top.png)   

If you don't see the team or team project you want, choose the ![](/vsts/boards/_img/icons/project-icon.png) Azure DevOps logo to [browse all projects and teams](/vsts/user-guide/account-home-pages).  

If you don't see **Analytics**, your screen size may be reduced. Choose the three dots (![expand menu](/vsts/report/_img/icons/menu-expand-icon.png), then choose **Analytics**, and then **Analytics views**.

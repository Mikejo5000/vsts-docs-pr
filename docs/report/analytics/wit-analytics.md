#Analytics - Work Item Tracking OData queries 

**VSTS**  

[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/analytics-preview.md)]

Using the OData service provided by the Analytics Marketplace extension, you can construct basic and filtered queries to return work items of interest. With basic querying capabilities you can query data directly from your browser.

In this topic, the basic root URL is constructed as follows:

```https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview ``` 


All additional URL parts are specified as an additional part of the query string as shown in the examples below.   


##Construct a basic query  

###Query a single entity
To query a single entity, such as Work Items or Areas or Projects, simply add the name of the entity: ```/Areas```, ```/Projects```,  or ```/WorkItems```.

For example, you query Areas by adding ```/Areas```. The full URL is:

```https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/Areas ```

This is equivalent to performing a select statement on the entity and returning everything, all columns and all rows. If you have a large number of work items, this may take several seconds.
 
### Select specific columns  
Return specific field data by adding a ```$select``` clause. 

For example, to return only the Work Item ID, Work Item Type, Title, and State of work items, enter:   

	/WorkItems?$select=WorkItemId,WorkItemType,Title,State	

This is equivalent to selecting all rows in the entity, but returning only these specific fields.  

>[!NOTE]
>There are no spaces in the field names. The query fails when you add spaces. Both spacing and casing are critical in OData.  


### Target a specific project  

Because team projects are an integral part of VSTS, we have added the ability to specify the project scope in the URL. By specifying the project, you automatically filter for any entities that are related to the project entity.

For example, the following project-scoped query will return the count of work items for a specific project:  

    https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/ProjectA/_odata/v1.0-preview/WorkItems/$count

Likewise, this query string will return the areas for a specific project:

    https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/ProjectA/_odata/v1.0-preview/Areas

This is equivalent to the following filter on a collection-scoped query:

    https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/Areas?$filter=Project/ProjectName eq 'ProjectA'   


When using a project-scoped query with an expand you are not required to provide additional filters.

For example, the following project scoped filter:

	https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/ProjectA/_odata/v1.0-preview/WorkItems?$expand=Parent

Would be filtered automatically to enforce security:

	https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/WorkItems?$filter=ProjectName eq 'ProjectA'&$expand=Parent($filter=ProjectName eq 'ProjectA')


When using a collection-scoped query with an ```$expand``` you must provide an additional filter.

For example, the following collection-scoped query, which uses an ```$expand``` to retrieve the children of all work items:
	
	https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/WorkItems?$expand=Children&$filter=Project/ProjectName eq 'ProjectA'

 Requires an additional filter to verify the children are limited to the specified project:
	
	https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/WorkItems?$expand=Children($filter=Project/ProjectName eq 'ProjectA')&$filter=Project/ProjectName eq 'ProjectA'

This query, which uses an ```$expand``` to retrieve the parent of all work items:

	https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/WorkItems?$expand=Parent&$filter=Project/ProjectName eq 'ProjectA'

Requires an additional filter to verify the parent is limited to the specified project:

	https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/WorkItems?$expand=Parent($filter=Project/ProjectName eq 'ProjectA')&$filter=Project/ProjectName eq 'ProjectA'

Without the additional filter, the request will fail if the child of any work item references work items in a project that you do not have read access to.


Analytics has a few additional restrictions on query syntax related to Project level security.

The ```any``` or ```all``` filters apply to the base Entity on an ```$expand```.  For filters based on a Project we explicitly ignore the filter when using an ```$expand```:

	https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/WorkItems?$expand=Children&$filter=ProjectName eq 'ProjectA' and Children/any(r: r/ProjectName eq 'ProjectA')

Using ```$level``` is only supported if you have access to all projects in the collection or when using a project scoped query:
	
	https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/WorkItems?$expand=Children($levels=2;$filter=ProjectName eq 'ProjectA')

Analytics does not understand or support any cross level reference with Projects. As an example, this query is referencing the root work itemâ€™s ProjectName using $it alias which is unsupported:

	https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/WorkItems?$expand=Links($expand=TargetWorkItem;$filter=TargetWorkItem/Project/ProjectName eq $it/Project/ProjectName)

>[!NOTE]
>If you don't have access to all projects in an account, apply a project filter to your query. When pulling data into client tools such as
>Power BI Desktop or Excel, use the project path form of the URL to ensure your data is constrained by a project, unless you need to report on more than one project.

###Filter results  

You can filter data by providing a query filter clause.  

Building on the last query, what if you wanted to filter the work items so that only items with the state "In Progress" were returned? To do that, use the following:

    /WorkItems?$select=WorkItemId,WorkItemType,Title,State&$filter=State eq 'In Progress'

Alternatively, you can exclude the ```$select``` clause altogether and just filter the results as follows:

    /WorkItems?$filter=State eq 'In Progress'

You can apply multiple filters by concatenating the filters:  

    /WorkItems?$filter=WorkItemType eq 'Task' and State eq 'In Progress'

Additionally, you can apply various functions such as ```contains```, ```startswith```, ```endswith``` and more. See the [Filter and order by canonical functions](#canonical-functions) section later in this topic. 

## Query with filters  
Querying work items is helpful, but you will eventually want to be able to filter by other data such as the Iteration Path
or Area Path or Team Project. To do this, you need to understand the navigation properties of the entity model.  

Here is a partial view of the metadata for the Work Items entity:


```XML
    <Property ...>
    <Property Name="RequirementType" Type="Edm.String"/>
    <Property Name="RequiresReview" Type="Edm.String"/>
    <Property Name="RequiresTest" Type="Edm.String"/>
    <Property Name="RootCause" Type="Edm.String"/>
    <Property Name="SubjectMatterExpert1" Type="Edm.String"/>
    <Property Name="SubjectMatterExpert2" Type="Edm.String"/>
    <Property Name="SubjectMatterExpert3" Type="Edm.String"/>
    <Property Name="TargetResolveDate" Type="Edm.DateTimeOffset"/>
    <Property Name="TaskType" Type="Edm.String"/>
    <Property Name="UserAcceptanceTest" Type="Edm.String"/>
    <Property Name="Count" Nullable="false" Type="Edm.Int32"/>
    <NavigationProperty Name="Revisions" Type="Collection(Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Analytics.Model.WorkItemRevision)"/>
    <NavigationProperty Name="BoardLocations" Type="Collection(Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Analytics.Model.BoardLocation)"/>
    <NavigationProperty Name="Project" Type="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Analytics.Model.Project"/>
    <NavigationProperty Name="Area" Type="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Analytics.Model.Area"/>
    <NavigationProperty Name="Iteration" Type="Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Analytics.Model.Iteration"/>
```



The navigation properties appear towards the bottom of the metadata, which includes ```Revisions```,  ```BoardLocations``` (Kanban metadata), ```Project```, ```Area```, and ```Iteration```. 

How do you use navigation properties to filter results? 

This query returns all of the work items in a specific iteration:

    /WorkItems?$filter=Iteration/IterationPath eq 'Project Name\Iteration 1'

In this example, ```Iteration``` is the navigation property name and ```IterationPath``` is the full path for the iteration. To use another entity as a filter, put the navigation property followed by a slash followed by the name of the field to filter on.  

##Return data from related entities

How do you use navigation properties to select related fields?

The username for Custom fields based on an Identity is not directly accessible using a ```$select``` statement. The following query uses a ```$expand``` statement to retrieve the Username:

    /WorkItems?$expand=MyIdentityField($select=UserName)

>[!NOTE]
>You can't use the navigation property directly in a ```$select``` statement. Instead, you will need to use ```$expand```.

The filtering example above was on the iteration path but the iteration path is not returned in the results because it is contained in a related entity.  To return data in a related entity, add an ```$expand``` statement:

    /WorkItems?$select=WorkItemId,WorkItemType,Title,State&$filter=WorkItemId eq 10000&$expand=Iteration

This returns the following:  

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
```JSON
{
  "@odata.context":"https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/$metadata#WorkItems(WorkItemId,WorkItemType,Title,State,Iteration)",
  "value":[
    {
      "WorkItemId":10000,
      "WorkItemType":"Task",
      "Title":"Some title",
      "State":"Completed",
      "Iteration":{
        "IterationId":"7a2c246e-fc62-41af-ad18-62332017bc46",
        "Name":"Sprint 55",
        "Number":13021,
        "IterationPath":"Fabrikam\\Sprints\\Sprint 55",
        "StartDate":"2013-09-23T00:00:00Z",
        "EndDate":"2013-10-11T00:00:00Z",
        "IterationLevel1":"Fabrikam",
        "IterationLevel2":"Sprints",
        "IterationLevel3":"Sprint 55",
        "Level":2,
        "IsDeleted":false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Iteration is expanded in the JSON result and all of the iteration data is returned. This is probably more data than you want.  

To return less data, add a ```$select``` statement against the iteration as well:

    /WorkItems?$select=WorkItemId,WorkItemType,Title,State&$filter=WorkItemId eq 10000&$expand=Iteration($select=Name,IterationPath)

Which returns the following:
```JSON
{
  "@odata.context":"https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/$metadata#WorkItems(WorkItemId,WorkItemType,Title,State,Iteration,Iteration(Name,IterationPath))",
  "value":[
    {
      "WorkItemId":10000,
      "WorkItemType":"Task",
      "Title":"Some title",
      "State":"Completed",
      "Iteration":{
        "Name":"Sprint 55",
        "IterationPath":"Fabrikam\\Sprints\\Sprint 55"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In OData, you can nest ```$expand``` statements. For example, you can write the previous query statement to display the project the iteration is part of:

    /WorkItems?$filter=WorkItemId eq 10000&$expand=Iteration($expand=Project)

This results in:
```JSON
{
  "@odata.context":"https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/$metadata#WorkItems","value":[
    {
      "WorkItemId":10000,
      "Revision":3,
      "Watermark":283397,
      "Title":"Production deployment and testing for Entitlement API v2 and Subscriber database",
      "WorkItemType":"Task",
      "ChangedDate":"2014-07-10T19:29:58.41Z",
      "CreatedDate":"2014-04-19T22:44:58.31Z",
      "State":"Completed",
      "Reason":"Completed",
      "Priority":2,
      "CompletedWork":10.0,
      "OriginalEstimate":20.0,
      "Count":1,
      "Iteration":{
        "IterationId":"7a2c246e-fc62-41af-ad18-62332017bc46",
        "Name":"Sprint 55",
        "Number":13021,
        "IterationPath":"Fabrikam\\Sprints\\Sprint 55",
        "StartDate":"2013-09-23T00:00:00Z",
        "EndDate":"2013-10-11T00:00:00Z",
        "IterationLevel1":"Fabrikam",
        "IterationLevel2":" Sprints",
        "IterationLevel3":"Sprint 55",
        "Level":2,
        "IsDeleted":false,
        "Project":{
          "ProjectId":"b924d696-3eae-4116-8443-9a18392d8544",
          "ProjectName":"Fabrikam",
          "IsDeleted":false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

You can also combine ```$expand``` and ```$select``` statements. For example, you can change the previous query to only return the Iteration Name and Iteration Path:

    /WorkItems?$filter=WorkItemId eq 10000&$expand=Iteration($select=IterationId,IterationPath;$expand=Project)

This results in:
```JSON
{
  "@odata.context":"https://{account}.analytics.visualstudio.com/_odata/v1.0-preview/$metadata#WorkItems(Iteration(IterationId,IterationPath,Project))",
  "value":[
    {
      "WorkItemId":10000,
      "Revision":3,
      "Watermark":283397,
      "Title":"Production deployment and testing for Entitlement API v2 and Subscriber database","WorkItemType":"Task",
      "ChangedDate":"2014-07-10T19:29:58.41Z",
      "CreatedDate":"2014-04-19T22:44:58.31Z",
      "State":"Completed",
      "Reason":"Completed",
      "Priority":2,
      "CompletedWork":10.0,
      "OriginalEstimate":20.0,
      "Count":1,
      "Iteration":{
        "IterationId":"7a2c246e-fc62-41af-ad18-62332017bc46","IterationPath":"Fabrikam\\Sprints\\Sprint 55",
        "Project":{
          "ProjectId":"b924d696-3eae-4116-8443-9a18392d8544",
          "ProjectName":"Fabrikam",
          "IsDeleted":false
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice that the result here shows only the IterationId and IterationPath and that the Project is a nested object within the JSON result.  Another key item to note is the URL itself, when using a ```$select``` statement and an ```$expand``` clause you must use a semi-colon (;) before the ```$expand```. Anything else will result in an error.

###Sort results

You can sort OData results using the ```$orderby``` clause. You can apply this clause to any OData query as shown:

    /WorkItems?$filter=WorkItemType eq 'User Story'&$orderby=WorkItemId

You can order by multiple items, but you can only order by columns that are returned. For example, the following entry will result in an error:  

    /WorkItems?$select=WorkItemId,WorkItemType,State&$orderby=Reason

# Add charts and widgets to a dashboard

<b>Team Services | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015.1-2015.3  </b>  


Widgets smartly format data to provide access to easily consumable data. You add widgets to your team dashboards to gain visibility into the status and trends occurring as you develop your software project. 

Each widget provides access to a chart, user-configurable information, or a set of links that open a feature or function. 

You can add one or more charts or widgets to your dashboard. You add several widgets at a time simply by selecting each one. See [Dashboards, Manage dashboards](dashboards.md#manage) to determine the permissions you need to add and remove widgets from a dashboard.    

>[!IMPORTANT]  
><b>Feature availability: </b> You can access the [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) from the web portal for Team Services or TFS 2015.1 or later version. The widget catalog provides widgets for all tiles supported in previous releases of TFS for the team homepage. For on-premises TFS 2015, you can add select charts to the team home page using the [Pin to home page](team-dashboard.md) feature.   
>
>To determine the platform and version you're on, see [Provide product and content feedback, Platforms and version support](../provide-feedback.md#platform-version).   



## Add a widget to a dashboard  

For Team Services and TFS 2015.1 and later versions, you can add a widget to a dashboard. 
 
>[!NOTE]  
>Widget images may vary depending on which platform you access. This topic shows images that appear in Team Services. However, the widget title and functionality described in this topic are valid for both Team Services and TFS. For example, dashboard edit mode controls shown below are valid for Team Services and TFS 2015.2 and later version. Some functionality differs when you connect to TFS 2015.1 or earlier versions.  
 
Click ![Edit dashboard icon](_img/edit-dashboard-icon.png) to modify a dashboard. Click ![add a widget icon](_img/add-widget-icon.png) to add a widget to the dashboard.  

The [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) describes all the available widgets, many of which are scoped to the selected team context.  

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b>For Team Services and TFS 2017 and later versions, you can drag and drop a widget from the catalog onto the dashboard.    


## Configure a widget  

To configure a widget, add the widget to a dashboard and then click the ![configure icon](_img/icons/configure-icon.png) configure icon. 

![Work item chart unconfigured widget](_img/add-widget-configure-initial.png)  

Click the delete icon to remove the tile from the dashboard. 
 
Once you've configured the widget, you can edit it by opening the actions menu.

1. These charts are configured by the system. You can't edit them. 
2. These charts are user-configurable.     
 


>[!NOTE]  
>**Required permissions:** You must be a team admin to add a chart to a team dashboard or homepage, or be [granted permissions to manage a dashboard](dashboards.md#manage). Or, if you're a member of the Project Administrators group, you can add charts to any team's dashboards or home page. 
 

<a id="build-history"></a>
###Add a build history chart

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b> This chart is supported from Team Services and TFS 2015.1 and later versions. With Team Services and later versions of TFS, you can also add it to a team dashboard from the [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md#build-history-widget).  

Each time a build is run, it logs information about the build, including the run time, errors and warnings, and whether it successfully completed or failed.   

1. Select your [team context](#switch-team-context) and then open the Build hub to add a build history chart to a team dashboard.   

	![Add a build summary chart to a dashboard](_img/add-chart-build-summary.png)  

	If you aren't a team administrator, [get added as one](../work/scale/add-team-administrator.md). The Add to dashboard menu selection is disabled when you don't have permissions to add it to the dashboards of the selected team context.  

2. Build summary charts look like this:  

	![Add a test plan chart to a dashboard](_img/add-a-dashboard-build-summary.png)  

	Hover over a bar to view build information and run time. Click a bar to go to the build summary page.   


<a id="release-summary"></a>
### Add a release summary chart

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b> This chart is supported from Team Services and TFS 2017.1 and later versions. You can also add it to a team dashboard from the [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md#release-definition-widget).  

Each time a [release is deployed](../build/actions/view-manage-releases.md#add-widget), it logs information about the release to each of its environments. You can add a release tile to your team dashboard to monitor release progress and gain quick access to each release. 

1. Select your [team context](#switch-team-context) and then open the Release hub to add a release definition chart to a team dashboard.   

	![Add a Release definition chart to a dashboard](_img/add-cd-release-definition.png)  

	If you aren't a team administrator, [get added as one](../Work/scale/add-team-administrator.md). The Add to dashboard menu selection is disabled when you don't have permissions to add it to the dashboards of the selected team context.  

2. Release definition charts show the success (green), in progress (blue), cancellation (red), or non-deployment (grey) to an environment for the current and last four releases:

<a id="test-result">  </a>  
### Add a test status or result chart  

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b> This feature is supported from Team Services and TFS 2015.  

As you create and run tests, you can track your status by defining [lightweight charts of test plans and test results](../test/manual-exploratory-testing/getting-started/track-test-status.md).  

1. Select your [team context](#switch-team-context), make sure you're a [team admin](../Work/scale/add-team-administrator.md), and if you haven't yet created the dashboard, [do that now](dashboards.md).  

2. Open the Test hub charts page and select the dashboard to add the test chart to.

<a id="test-quality"></a>  
### Add a test quality trend chart   

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b> This chart is supported from Team Services and TFS 2015.2 or later versions. From Team Services and TFS 2017 and later versions, you can add a [test result trend chart widget](widget-catalog.md#test-results-widget) to a team dashboard. 


You can add trends to the dashboard of the failures and duration of those [tests that were run as part of a build](../test/continuous-testing/getting-started/getting-started-with-continuous-testing.md).  

1. Select your [team context](#switch-team-context), make sure you're a [team admin](../Work/scale/add-team-administrator.md), and if you haven't yet created the dashboard, [do that now](dashboards.md).  

2. Open a build summary for a build definition to which you've added tests, open the Tests page, and click the bar chart for either Test failures or Test duration.    

	![Add a test plan chart to a dashboard](_img/add-chart-test-quality.png)  

3. Click the ![Actions icon](../work/_img/icons/actions-icon.png) Actions menu and choose the dashboard to add the chart to.  

	![Open Actions menu and select dashboard](_img/add-chart-test-failures.png)

<a id="work-item-query"></a>
###Add a work item query or chart  

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b> This feature is supported from Team Services or TFS 2015. With Team Services, you can add a [work item query chart widget](widget-catalog.md#build-history-widget) to a team dashboard.  


You add work item queries and charts to a dashboard from the Queries page. Queries and charts must be associated with queries under the Shared queries folder.  

1. First, make sure you have selected your team context. Only those dashboards created for a team appear in the context menu for each query or chart. [Switch team context](#switch-team-context) as needed.  

2. If you aren't a team administrator, [get added as one](../Work/scale/add-team-administrator.md). Only team and project admins can add and customize team dashboards.  

3. If you haven't yet created the dashboard, [do that now](dashboards.md).  

4. From the charts Actions menu, choose the team dashboard.  

	![Chart context menu, add to a dashboard](_img/pin-chart-to-a-dashboard.png)  

	You can only add charts associated with shared queries. Charts associated with queries under My Queries folder won't display the add to dashboard option.

<a id="markdown-widget">  </a>
## Markdown widgets   

Use these widgets to support your team and stakeholders by adding information such as:  
- Team goals  
- Provide links to team backlogs or boards, metrics, or other items located in a network share such as a OneNote, SharePoint site or wiki pages   
- Important dates or target deadlines  

Here's an example:  

<img src="../reference/_img/markdown-widget-configured.png" alt="Web portal, Sample Markdown widget" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" /> 


>[!NOTE]  
>Links to documents on file shares using `file://` are not supported on Team Services or TFS 2017.1 and later versions. This restriction has been implemented for security purposes.
>
>For information on how to specify relative links from a Welcome page or Markdown widget, see [Source control relative links](../reference/markdown-guidance.md#relative-links).

## Related notes

To learn more about charts and dashboards, see the following topics:   

- [Charts, dashboards, and widgets](overview.md) 
- [Create a status or trend chart from a work item query](charts.md)  
- [Create and customize team dashboards](dashboards.md)  
- [Widget catalog](widget-catalog.md)  


### System-generated work tracking charts 

There are a number of system-generated charts that you can access from the web portal, but can't add to a dashboard. However, you may find a comparable widget listed in the [widget catalog](widget-catalog.md) that tracks the same or similar data which you can add to the dashboard. These include: 

- [Velocity chart](../work/scrum/velocity-and-forecasting.md)
- [Sprint burndown chart](../work/scrum/sprint-burndown.md) (see [Sprint burndown widget](widget-catalog.md#sprint-burndown-widget))
- [Cumulative flow](guidance/cumulative-flow.md) (see [CFD widget](widget-catalog.md#cfd-widget))

### Marketplace widgets

You may find additional widgets of interest from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=webpage%20widget&target=VSTS&sortBy=Relevance).  

If your account or project collection administrator disables a marketplace widget, you'll see the following image: 

<img src="_img/widget-catalog-disabled-widget.png" alt="Disabled widget extension notification" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />   

To regain access to it, request your admin to reinstate or reinstall the widget. 

### Widget size

Some widgets are pre-sized and can't be changed. Others are configurable through their configuration dialog. 

For example, the Chart for work items widget allows you to select an area size ranging from 2 x 2  to 4 x 4 (tiles).  


<img src="_img/add-widget-size.png" alt="Change widget size" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />   

### Extensibility 

Using the REST API service, you can [create a dashboard widget](../../integrate/extensions/develop/add-dashboard-widget.md). To learn more about the REST APIs for dashboards and widgets, see [Dashboards (API)](../../integrate/api/dashboard/overview.md).

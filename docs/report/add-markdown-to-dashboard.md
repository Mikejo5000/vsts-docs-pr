# Add Markdown to a dashboard

<b>VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015.1-2015.3  </b>  

<a id="markdown-widget">  </a> 

Use the Markdown widget to support your team and stakeholders by adding information such as:  
- Team goals  
- Provide links to team backlogs or boards, metrics, or other items located in a network share such as a OneNote, SharePoint site or wiki pages   
- Important dates or target deadlines  

Here's an example:  

<img src="../collaborate/_img/markdown-guidance/markdown-widget-configured.png" alt="Web portal, Sample Markdown widget" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" /> 


>[!NOTE]  
>Links to documents on file shares using `file://` are not supported on VSTS or TFS 2017.1 and later versions. This restriction has been implemented for security purposes.
>
>For information on how to specify relative links from a Welcome page or Markdown widget, see [Source control relative links](../collaborate/markdown-guidance.md#relative-links). 

To edit a markdown widget, you must be a team admin or a member of the Project Administrators group. To be added as a team admin, go [here](../work/scale/add-team-administrator.md).

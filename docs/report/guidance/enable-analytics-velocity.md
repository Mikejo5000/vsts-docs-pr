##  Learn about your teamâ€™s velocity using the Velocity widget 

The Velocity widget will help you learn how much work your team can complete during a sprint. The widget shows the team's velocity by Story Points, work item count, or any custom field. You can also compare the work delivered against your plan and track work completed late. Using the Velocity widget, you will be able to answer questions like:
* On average, what is the velocity of my team?
* Is my team consistently delivering what we planned?
* How much work can we commit to deliver in upcoming sprints? 

**Velocity widget showing 8 sprints of data based on Story Points.**

Here, the Velocity widget shows this team has a history of closing stories late. It also shows a discrepency between planned and completed work in the past 4 sprints. The team can drill into the data to determine the root causes. After implementing new practices, the team can use the Velocity widget to track their effectiveness.

Learn more about the Velocity widget in [Configure and view Velocity widgets](./team-velocity.md).

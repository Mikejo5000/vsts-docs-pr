# Configure TFS-SharePoint integration

[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](./_shared/about-sharepoint-deprecation.md)]

By adding one or more servers running SharePoint Products to your Team Foundation Server (TFS) deployment, you can add Web publishing and project collaboration features to Team Foundation. These features can improve communication and increase sharing ideas among users who are assigned tasks in team projects. 

The project portal for your team project provides a central location for storing documents, posting announcements, listing build information, and reporting on your team project status. To utilize the integration between Visual Studio Team Foundation Server and SharePoint Products, you must add users to one or more groups and roles in SharePoint Products, depending on the functionality required to do their jobs.

In addition, you can customize SharePoint Web applications in a number of ways to better meet the needs of your organization, including organizing Web sites in a predictable hierarchy or sharing process guidance across your organization.

To get started...

The TFS/SharePoint integration for TFS 2017 and earlier versions requires you to do the following:
* [Install the TFS Extension for SharePoint on the SharePoint server](/vsts/tfs-server/install/sharepoint/install-sharepoint?toc=/vsts/report/sharepoint-dashboards/toc.json&bc=/vsts/report/sharepoint-dashboards/breadcrumb/toc.json).
* From the TFS Management Console on TFS, [configure your TFS server to grant access to the SharePoint server](../../tfs-server/install/sharepoint/config-enterprise-app-def.md?toc=/vsts/report/sharepoint-dashboards/toc.json&bc=/vsts/report/sharepoint-dashboards/breadcrumb/toc.json).
* From the TFS Management Console on SharePoint, [configure your SharePoint server to grant access to your TFS Server](/vsts/tfs-server/admin/config-ent-sharepoint0710-dashboards?toc=/vsts/report/sharepoint-dashboards/toc.json&bc=/vsts/report/sharepoint-dashboards/breadcrumb/toc.json).
* If you plan to take advantage of Excel Charts on your SharePoint sites:
  * On SharePoint 2010, you need to [configure Office SharePoint Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee462863%28v=vs.100%29.aspx).
  * On SharePoint 2013, you need to [configure Excel Services](../../tfs-server/install/sharepoint/install-sharepoint.md).

# Switch team project or team focus   

[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

<a id="switch-team-context">  </a>

Several features depend on the team project or team that you have selected. For example, dashboards, backlogs, and board views will change depending on the context selected. 

For example, when you add a work item, the system references the default area and iteration paths defined for the team context. Work items you add from the team dashboard (new work item widget) and queries page are assigned the team default iteration. Work items you add from a team backlog or board, are assigned the team default backlog iteration. To change team defaults, see [Set team defaults](../work/scale/set-team-defaults.md?toc=/vsts/settings/toc.json&bc=/vsts/settings/breadcrumb/toc.json).  

You navigate to your team context from the top navigation bar. The method changes slightly depending on the platform/version you work from.     

## View teams   

To view a list of teams defined for a team project, open the admin context for the team project, and choose **Overview**.  

>[!NOTE]  
>**Feature availability**: The **Change process** link is only supported for team projects that use the [Inheritance process model](../work/customize/inheritance-process-model.md).

## Projects: Navigate to a team project 
From the **Projects** page you can quickly navigate to a team project or a team that you've accessed or worked in previously. Projects are listed in the order you've last accessed, with the most recent five projects accessed appearing first. All projects you've accessed are listed within the **All** section.

As you hover over the project, you can click one of the links to go to the Home (dashboards), Code, Work, Build & Release, or Test hub of the team project. Click the ![favorites](../_img/icons/icon-favorite-star.png) star icon to mark the team project as a favorite.

### Filter projects and teams
If a project isn't listed, you can find it by searching for it using the *Filter projects and teams* search box. Simply type a keyword contained within the name of a team project or team. Here we type **Design** to find the Contoso project Design team.

### Add a team project

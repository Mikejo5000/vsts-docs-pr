# Enable preview features 

**Azure CodeX**  

As new features are introduced, you can turn them on or off. That way, you can try them out, provide feedback, and work with those features that meet your requirements.  

Some features provide a new user interface and functionality, which can be managed per user or team member. Others support a default experience for the account and are managed by an account administrator.

## Enable features at the account level (for all users)  

When you enable a feature at the account level, you essentially turn it on for all users of your account. Each user can then disable the feature if they so choose.

>[!TIP]  
>If you don't see the user/account menu option, then you aren't an account administrator. To get added as one, see [Add administrators, set permissions at the team project or collection level](../security/set-project-collection-level-permissions.md).

# Navigation basics 

**Azure CodeX**  

Here's what you need to know to get up and running using Azure CodeX or one of its apps.  

- **[Start page](go-to-app-hub-page.md)**: use to switch an app or a team project 
- **[Search box](search-basics.md)**: use to find code, work items, or a wiki page 
- **[Your profile menu](enable-preview-feature.md?toc=/vsts/navigation/toc.json&bc=/vsts/navigation/breadcrumb/toc.json)**: use to set personal preferences, notifications, and preview features  
- **[Settings](../settings/index.md)**: use to add teams, manage security, and configure other project and account-level elements 
- **Help**: use to quickly access the most relevant topics for the page you're on.  

Each app provides you with one or more pages which support a number of features and functional operations. Within a functional view, you may then have a choice of options to select a specific object or artifact or create an artifact.  

You can choose between vertical and horizontal navigation by selecting the option through [Preview Features](enable-preview-feature.md).

# [Vertical navigation](#tab/vertical)

In vertical navigation mode, you select applications&mdash;such as **Codex Repos**, **Codex Pipelines**, and **Codex Agile**&mdash;and pages within those apps.

# [Horizontal navigation](#tab/horizontal)

In horizontal navigation mode, you select an application hub&mdash;such as **Code**, **Work**, and **Build and Release**&mdash;and pages within those apps.

Now that you have an understanding of how the user interface is structure, it's time to get started using it.  As you can see, there are a lot of features and functionality.  

If all you need is a code repository and bug tracking solution, then start with the [Get started with Git and CodeVault](../git/gitquickstart.md) and [Manage bugs with Codex Agile](../work/backlogs/manage-bugs.md).  

To start planning and tracking work, see [Get started with Agile tools to plan and track work](../work/backlogs/overview.md?context=vsts/default).

#Create a new artifact or team

You create a new artifact from the following pages: 

##CodeBox

## Create Git artifacts 
- [Git repository](/vsts/git/tutorial/creatingrepo?tabs=visual-studio)
- [Git branch](/vsts/git/create-branch)
- [Git commit](/vsts/git/tutorial/commits?tabs=visual-studio)
- [Git local branch](/vsts/git/tutorial/branches?tabs=visual-studio)
- [Git pull request](/vsts/git/tutorial/pullrequest) 
- [Fork](/vsts/git/concepts/forks)
- [Git tag](/vsts/git/how-to/git-tags?tabs=vsts-tfs-web-portal)
- [README](/vsts/git/create-a-readme)

## Create TFVC artifacts

TBD 

##CodePlan

To add a product backlog, Kanban board, dashboard or other 

- [Add a team](/vsts/work/scale/multiple-teams?toc=/vsts/teams/toc.json&bc=/vsts/teams/breadcrumb/toc.json)  
	When you add a team, you add the following artifacts that each team can configure to meet their needs:  
	- [Product backlog](/vsts/work/backlogs/create-your-backlog)
	- [Feature and Epic portfolio backlogs](/vsts/work/backlogs/define-features-epics)
	- [Kanban boards](/vsts/work/kanban/kanban-quickstart)

	When you select iteration paths for use by a team, you create the following artfifacts for each iteration:  
	- [Sprint backlog](/vsts/work/scrum/sprint-planning)
	- [Sprint task board](/vsts/work/scrum/task-board)

- [Delivery plan](/vsts/work/scale/review-team-plans)
- [Work item](/vsts/work/work-items/view-add-work-items)


###Customize work tracking 
- [Add area paths](/vsts/work/customize/set-area-paths)
- [Add iterations](/vsts/work/customize/set-iteration-paths-sprints)

You customize a team project by customizing a process. 
- [Add or modify a process](/vsts/work/customize/process/manage-process)
- [Add or customize a work item type](/vsts/work/customize/process/customize-process-wit)
- [Add a custom field](/vsts/work/customize/process/customize-process-field)
- [Add a custom rule](/vsts/work/customize/process/custom-rules)
- [Add a custom control](/vsts/work/customize/process/custom-controls-process)
- [Add a custom backlog](/vsts/work/customize/process/customize-process-backlogs-boards)


## Dashboards and Wikis

Dashboards are typically associated with teams. Each team can create and configure a number of dashboards. One wiki can be created for a team project.  

- [Add a dashboard](/vsts/report/dashboards/dashboards)
- [Create a wiki](/vsts/collaborate/wiki-create-repo)
- [Add and edit a wiki page](/vsts/collaborate/add-edit-wiki)

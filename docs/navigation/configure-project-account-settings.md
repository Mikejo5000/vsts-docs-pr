# Configure project and account settings

**Azure CodeX**  

 You use the administrative context to set team, team project, and account or collection settings. The hubs and pages available change based on what level of administrative context you're in.

To get started, from a [supported web browser](../tfs-server/requirements.md#browsers) enter the following URL:


The web portal is one of several clients that can connect to a team project. 

<a id="admin-context">  </a>

## Administrative context and team, team project, and account/collection settings

From a user context, open the admin context by clicking the ![gear icon](../_img/icons/gear-icon.png) gear Settings icon. The tabs and pages available differ depending on which admin context you access.

Below we show the admin context for the team project level. 

<a id="admin-intro" />

<a id="admin-intro-team-services" />  

Open any admin page by clicking it's name. Click or hover over the gear icon to access other administrative options. Note that you can click any of the user-context hubs of **Home**, **Code**, **Work**, and so on to return to the user context.

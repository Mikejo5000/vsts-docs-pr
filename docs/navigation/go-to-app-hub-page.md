# Navigate to an application, hub, or page  

[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Guide to navigating within the web portal for Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Team Foundation Server (TFS). 

The web portal provides support for teams to collaborate through the planning, development, and release cycles. You use the web portal to perform both software development and administrative tasks.  

You can manage source code, plan and track work, define builds, run tests, and manage releases. The web portal connects you to the team project defined for an account in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) or within an on-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS). 

If you don't have a team project yet, create one in [VSTS](../accounts/create-account-msa-or-work-student.md?toc=/vsts/accounts/toc.json&bc=/vsts/accounts/breadcrumb/toc.json) or set one up in an [on-premises TFS](../accounts/create-team-project.md). If you don't have access to the team project, [get invited to the team](../work/scale/multiple-teams.md#add-team-members).
  
To be written


Now that you have an understanding of how the user interface is structure, it's time to get started using it.  As you can see, there are a lot of features and functionality.  

If all you need is a code repository and bug tracking solution, then start with the [Git get started guide](../git/gitquickstart.md) and [Manage bugs](../work/backlogs/manage-bugs.md?toc=/vsts/work/work-items/toc.json&bc=/vsts/work/work-items/breadcrumb/toc.json).  

To start planning and tracking work, see [Get started with Agile tools to plan and track work](../work/backlogs/overview.md?toc=/vsts/work/work-items/toc.json&bc=/vsts/work/work-items/breadcrumb/toc.json).

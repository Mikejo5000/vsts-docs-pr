# Continuous testing scenarios and capabilities

**Team Services | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | [Previous version](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee702477%28v=vs.120%29.aspx)**  

Whether your app is on-premises or in the cloud, 
you can automate build-deploy-test workflows and 
choose the technologies and frameworks, then test 
your changes continuously in a fast, scalable, and 
efficient manner.

## Maintain quality and find problems as you develop

Continuous testing with Visual Studio Team Services
or Team Foundation Server ensures your app still 
works after every check-in and build, enabling you 
to find problems earlier by running tests 
automatically with each build.

## Rich analytics and reporting

When your build is done, review your test results 
to start resolving the problems you find.
Rich and actionable build-on-build reports 
let you instantly see if your builds are getting 
healthier. But it's not just about speed - detailed and 
customizable test results measure the quality of 
your app.

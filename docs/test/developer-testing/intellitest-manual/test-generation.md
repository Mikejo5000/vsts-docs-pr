# Test generation

[!INCLUDE [irm-pages-header-shared](../../_shared/irm-pages-header-shared.md)]

In traditional unit testing, it requires several 
ingredients to put together a test:

```
[Test]
void MyTest() {
    // data
    ArrayList a = new ArrayList();

    // method sequence
    a.Add(5);

    // assertions
    Assert.IsTrue(a.Count==1);
    Assert.AreEqual(a[0], 5);
}
```

The test consists of different aspects:

* It fixes a [sequence of method calls](test-generation.md#test-generators)
* It fixes the arguments with which the methods are called; the arguments are the [test inputs](input-generation.md)
* It validates the intended behavior of the tested application by a stating a set of [assertions](#assumptions-and-assertions)

IntelliTest can often automatically determine 
relevant argument values for more general 
[Parameterized Unit Tests](#parameterized-unit-testing), 
which provide the sequence of method calls and assertions.

<a name="test-generators"></a>
## Test generators

IntelliTest generates test cases by selecting a 
sequence of methods of the implementation under test 
to execute, and then generating inputs for the 
methods while checking assertions over the derived data.

A [parameterized unit test](#parameterized-unit-testing)
directly states a sequence of method calls in its body.

When IntelliTest needs to construct objects, calls to
constructors and factory methods will be added 
automatically to the sequence as required.

<a name="parameterized-unit-testing"></a>
## Parameterized unit testing

*Parameterized Unit Tests* (PUTs) are tests that take
parameters. Unlike traditional unit tests, which are 
usually closed methods, PUTs take any set of 
parameters. Is it that simple? Yes - from there, 
IntelliTest will try to 
[generate the (minimal) set of inputs](input-generation.md)
that [fully cover](input-generation.md#dynamic-code-coverage)
the code reachable from the test.

PUTs are defined using the 
[PexMethod](attribute-glossary.md#pexmethod) custom 
attribute in a similar fashion to MSTest (or NUnit, 
xUnit). PUTs are instance methods logically grouped 
in classes tagged with 
[PexClass](attribute-glossary.md#pexclass). The 
following example shows a simple PUT stored in the 
**MyPexTest** class:

```
[PexMethod]
void ReplaceFirstChar(string target, char c) {

    string result = StringHelper.ReplaceFirstChar(target, c);

    Assert.AreEqual(result[0], c);
}
```

where **ReplaceFirstChar** is a method that replaces
the first character of a string:

```
class StringHelper {
    static string ReplaceFirstChar(string target, char c) {
        if (target == null) throw new ArgumentNullException();
        if (target.Length == 0) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException();
        return c + target.Substring(1);
    }
}
```

From this test, IntelliTest can automatically 
[generate inputs](input-generation.md) for a PUT that
covers many execution paths of the tested code. Each 
input that covers a different execution path gets 
"serialized" as a unit test:

```
[TestMethod, ExpectedException(typeof(ArgumentNullException))]
void ReplaceFirstChar0() {
    this.ReplaceFirstChar(null, 0);
}
...
[TestMethod]
void ReplaceFirstChar10() {
    this.ReplaceFirstChar("a", 'c');
}
```

<a name="generic-parameterized"></a>
## Generic parameterized unit testing

Parameterized unit tests can be generic methods. In 
this case, the user must specify the types used to 
instantiate the method by using 
[PexGenericArguments](attribute-glossary.md#pexgenericarguments).

```
[PexClass]
public partial class ListTest {
    [PexMethod]
    [PexGenericArguments(typeof(int))]
    [PexGenericArguments(typeof(object))]
    public void AddItem<T>(List<T> list, T value)
    { ... }
}
```

<a name="allowing-exceptions"></a>
## Allowing exceptions

IntelliTest provides numerous validation attributes 
to help triage exceptions into expected exceptions 
and unexpected exceptions.

Expected exceptions generate negative test cases with
the appropriate annotation such as 
**ExpectedException(typeof(*xxx*))**, while 
unexpected exceptions generate failing test cases.

```
[PexMethod, PexAllowedException(typeof(ArgumentNullException))]
void SomeTest() {...}
```

The validators are:

* [PexAllowedException](attribute-glossary.md#pexallowedexception): allows a particular exception type from anywhere
* [PexAllowedExceptionFromAssembly](attribute-glossary.md#pexallowedexceptionfromassembly): allows a particular exception type from a specified assembly
* [PexAllowedExceptionFromType](attribute-glossary.md#pexallowedexceptionfromtype): allows a particular exception type from a specified type
* [PexAllowedExceptionFromTypeUnderTest](attribute-glossary.md#pexallowedexceptionfromtypeundertest): allows a particular exception type from the type under test

<a name="internal-types"></a>
## Testing internal types

IntelliTest can "test" internal types, as long as it 
can see them. For IntelliTest to see the types, the 
following attribute is added to your product or test 
project by the Visual Studio IntelliTest wizards:

```
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Microsoft.Pex, PublicKey=002400000480000094000000060200000024000052534131000400000100010007d1fa57c4aed9f0a32e84aa0faefd0de9e8fd6aec8f87fb03766c834c99921eb23be79ad9d5dcc1dd9ad236132102900b723cf980957fc4e177108fc607774f29e8320e92ea05ece4e821c0a5efe8f1645c4c0c93c1ab99285d622caa652c1dfad63d745d6f2de5f17e5eaf0fc4963d261c8a12436518206dc093344d5ad293
```

<a name="assumptions-and-assertions"></a>
## Assumptions and assertions

Users can use assumptions and assertions to express 
[preconditions](#precondition) (assumptions) and 
[postconditions](#postcondition) (assertions) about 
their tests. When IntelliTest generates a set of 
parameter values and "explores" the code, it might 
violate an assumption of the test. When that happens,
it will not generate a test for that path but will
silently ignore it.

Assertions are a well known concept in regular unit 
test frameworks, so IntelliTest already "understands"
the built-in **Assert** classes provided by each 
supported test framework. However, most frameworks 
do not provide an **Assume** class. In that case, 
IntelliTest provides the 
[PexAssume](static-helper-classes.md#pexassume) class. 
If you do not want to use an existing test framework,
IntelliTest also has the 
[PexAssert](static-helper-classes.md#pexassert) class.

```
[PexMethod]
public void Test1(object o) {
    // precondition: o should not be null
    PexAssume.IsNotNull(o);

    ...
}
```

In particular, the non-nullness assumption can be 
encoded as a custom attribute:

```
[PexMethod]
public void Test2([PexAssumeNotNull] object o)
// precondition: o should not be null
{
   ...
}
```

<a name="precondition"></a>
## Precondition

A precondition of a method expresses the conditions
under which the method will succeed.

Usually, the precondition is enforced by checking the
parameters and the object state, and throwing an 
**ArgumentException** or **InvalidOperationException**
if it is violated.

In IntelliTest, a precondition of a 
[parameterized unit test](#parameterized-unit-testing)
is expressed with [PexAssume](static-helper-classes.md#pexassume).

<a name="postcondition"></a>
## Postcondition

A postcondition of a method expresses the conditions 
which should hold during and after execution of the 
method, assuming that its preconditions were initially valid.

Usually, the postcondition is enforced by calls to 
**Assert** methods.

With IntelliTest, a postcondition of a 
[parameterized unit test](#parameterized-unit-testing) 
is expressed with [PexAssert](static-helper-classes.md#pexassert).

<a name="test-failures"></a>
## Test failures
When does a generated test case fail?

1. If it does not terminate within the [configured path bounds](exploration-bounds.md), it is considered as a failure unless the [TestExcludePathBoundsExceeded](exploration-bounds.md#testexcludepathboundsexceeded) option is set

1. If the test throws a **PexAssumeFailedException**, it succeeds. However, it is usually filtered out unless [TestEmissionFilter](exploration-bounds.md#testemissionfilter) is set to **All**

1. If the test violates an [assertion](#assumptions-and-assertions); for example, by throwing an assertion violation exception of a unit testing framework, it fails

If none of the above produce a decision, a test 
succeeds if and only if it does not throw an 
exception. Assertion violations are treated 
in the same way as exceptions.

<a name="setup-teardown"></a>
## Setup and tear down

As part of the integration with test frameworks, 
IntelliTest supports detecting and running setup and 
tear down methods.

**Example**

```
using Microsoft.Pex.Framework;
using NUnit.Framework;

namespace MyTests
{
    [PexClass]
    [TestFixture]
    public partial class MyTestClass
    {
        [SetUp]
        public void Init()
        {
            // monitored
        }

        [PexMethod]
        public void MyTest(int i)
        {
        }

        [TearDown]
        public void Dispose()
        {
            // monitored
        }
    }
}

```

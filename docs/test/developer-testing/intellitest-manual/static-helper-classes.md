# Static helper classes

[!INCLUDE [irm-pages-header-shared](../../_shared/irm-pages-header-shared.md)]

IntelliTest provides a set of static helper class 
that can be used when authoring 
[parameterized unit tests](test-generation.md#parameterized-unit-testing):

* [PexAssume](#pexassume): used to define assumptions on inputs, and is useful for filtering undesirable inputs
* [PexAssert](#pexassert): a simple assertion class for use if your test framework does not provide one
* [PexChoose](#pexchoose): a stream of additional test inputs that IntelliTest manages
* [PexObserve](#pexobserve): logs concrete values and, optionaly, validates them in the generated code

Some classes allow you to interact with the 
IntelliTest reasoning engine at a low-level:

* [PexSymbolicValue](#pexsymbolicvalue): utilities to inspect or modify symbolic constraints on variables

<a name="pexassume"></a>
## PexAssume

A static class used to express assumptions, such as 
[preconditions](test-generation.md#precondition), in 
[parameterized unit tests](test-generation.md#parameterized-unit-testing).
The methods of this class can be used to filter out undesirable test inputs.

If the assumed condition does not hold for some test 
input, a **PexAssumeFailedException** is thrown. This 
will cause the test to be silently ignored.

**Example**

The following parameterized test will not consider 
**j=0**:

```
public void TestSomething(int i, int j) {
     PexAssume.AreNotEqual(j, 0);
     int k = i/j;
     ...
}
```

**Remarks**

The code above is almost equivalent to:

```
     if (j==0)
          return;
```

except that a failing **PexAssume** results in no 
test cases. In the case of an **if** statement, 
IntelliTest generates a separate test case to cover 
the **then** branch of the **if** statement.

**PexAssume** also contains specialzed nested classes
for assumptions on string, arrays, and collections.

<a name="pexassert"></a>
## PexAssert

A static class used to express assertions, such as
[postconditions](test-generation.md#postcondition), 
in [parameterized unit tests](test-generation.md#parameterized-unit-testing).

If the asserted condition does not hold for some test
input, a **PexAssertFailedException** is thrown, which 
causes the test to fail.

**Example**

The following asserts that the absolute value of an 
integer is positive:

```
public void TestSomething(int i) {
     int j = Maths.Abs(i);
     PexAssert.IsTrue(j >= 0);
     ...
}
```

<a name="pexchoose"></a>
## PexChoose

A static class that supplies auxiliary input values 
to a test, which can be used to implement 
[Parameterized Mocks](input-generation.md#parameterized-mocks).

The **PexChoose** class does not help in determining
whether a test passes or fails for particular input 
values. **PexChoose** simply provides input values,
which are also referred to as *choices*. It is still 
up to the user to restrict the input values, and to 
write assertions that define when a test passes or fails.

**Modes of operation**

The **PexChoose** class can operate in two modes:

* While IntelliTest is performing a symbolic analysis
  of the test and the tested code during 
  [input generation](input-generation.md), the chooser 
  returns arbitrary values and IntelliTest tracks how
  each value is used in the test and the tested code. IntelliTest will generate relevant values to trigger different execution paths in the test and the tested code.

* The generated code for particular test cases sets 
  up the choice provider in a specific way, so that 
  the re-execution of such a test case will make 
  specific choices to trigger a particular execution path.

**Usage**

* Simple call **PexChoose.Value** to generate a new value:

```
public int Foo() {
    return PexChoose.Value<int>("foo");
}
```

<a name="pexobserve"></a>
## PexObserve

A static class to log named values.

When IntelliTest explores the code, **PexObserve**
is used to record computed values using their 
formatted string representations. The values are 
associated with unique names.

```
PexObserve.Value<string>("result", result);
```

**Example**

```
// product code
public static class MathEx {
     public static int Square(int value) { return value * value; }
}


// fixture
[TestClass]
public partial class MathExTests {
     [PexMethod]
     public int SquareTest(int a) {
        int result = MathEx.Square(a); 
        // storing result
        return result;
     }
}
```

<a name="pexsymbolicvalue"></a>
## PexSymbolicValue

A static class used to ignore constraints on parameters,
and to print the symbolic information associated with values.

**Usage**

Normally, IntelliTest tries to cover all execution 
paths of the code during execution. However, 
especially when computing assumption and assertion 
conditions, it should not explore all possible cases.

**Example**

This example shows the implementation of the 
**PexAssume.Arrays.ElementsAreNotNull** method. 
In the method, you ignore the constraints on the 
lengh of the array value to avoid IntelliTest trying 
to generate different sizes of array. The constraints
are ignored only here. If the tested code behaves 
differently for different array lengths, IntelliTest 
cannot generate different sized arrays from the 
constraints of the tested code.

```
public static void AreElementsNotNull<T>(T[] value)
    where T : class
{
    PexAssume.NotNull(value);
    // the followings prevents the exploration of all array lengths
    int len = PexSymbolicValue.Ignore<int>(value.Length);

    // building up a boolean value as follows prevents exploration
    // of all combinations of non-null (instead, there are just two cases)
    bool anyNull = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i)
        anyNull |= value[i] == null;

    // was any element null?
    if (anyNull)
        PexAssume.Fail("some element of array is a null reference");
}
```

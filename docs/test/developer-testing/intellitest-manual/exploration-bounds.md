# Exploration bounds

[!INCLUDE [irm-pages-header-shared](../../_shared/irm-pages-header-shared.md)]

**PexSettingsAttributeBase** is the abstract base 
class for settings bounds as attributes. See 
[Settings Waterfall](settings-waterfall.md) 
for an overview of settings in IntelliTest.

You can modify the settings by using named properties
of this and its derived attributes:

```
[PexClass(MaxRuns = 10)]
public partial class FooTest {...}
```

* **Constraint solving bounds**
  * [MaxConstraintSolverTime](#maxconstraintsolvertime) - The number of seconds the [constraint solver](input-generation.md#constraint-solver) has to discover inputs that will cause a new and different execution path to be followed.
  * [MaxConstraintSolverMemory](#maxconstraintsolvermemory) - The size in Megabytes that the [constraint solver](input-generation.md#constraint-solver) may use to discover inputs.<p />
* **Exploration Path Bounds**
  * [MaxBranches](#maxbranches) - The maximum number of branches that may be taken along a single execution path.
  * [MaxCalls](#maxcalls) - The maximum number of calls that may be made during a single execution path.
  * [MaxStack](#maxstack) - The maximum size of the stack at any time during a single execution path, measured as the number of active call frames.
  * [MaxConditions](#maxconditions) - The maximum number of conditions over the inputs that may be checked during a single execution path.<p />
* **Exploration Bounds**
  * [MaxRuns](#maxruns) - The maximum number of runs that will be attempted during an exploration.
  * [MaxRunsWithoutNewTests](#maxrunswithoutnewtests) - The maximum number of consecutive runs without a new test being emitted.
  * [MaxRunsWithUniquePaths](#maxrunswithuniquepaths) - The maximum number of runs with unique execution paths that will be attempted during an exploration.
  * [MaxExceptions](#maxexceptions) - The maximum number of exceptions that may be found for a combination of all discovered execution paths.<p />
* **Test Suite Code Generation Settings**
  * [TestExcludePathBoundsExceeded](#testexcludepathboundsexceeded) - When true, execution paths which exceed any of the path bounds ([MaxCalls](#maxcalls), [MaxBranches](#maxbranches), [MaxStack](#maxstack), [MaxConditions](#maxconditions)) are ignored.
  * [TestEmissionFilter](#testemissionfilter) - Indicates under which circumstances IntelliTest should emit tests.
  * [TestEmissionBranchHits](#testemissionbranchhits) - Controls how many tests IntelliTest emits.

## MaxConstraintSolverTime

The number of seconds the 
[constraint solver](input-generation.md#constraint-solver) 
has to calculate inputs that will cause a new and 
different execution path to be taken. This is an 
option of the **PexSettingsAttributeBase** and its 
derived types.

The deeper that IntelliTest explores the execution 
paths of a program, the more complex the constraint 
systems that IntelliTest builds from the control-flow
and data-flow of the program become. Depending on 
your time limitation, you can set this value to allow 
IntelliTest to take more or less time discovering 
new execution paths.

Typically, the reason for a timeout is that 
IntelliTest is trying to find a solution for a 
constraint system that does not have a solution, 
but it is not aware of this fact. Since this is the 
most common case for a timeout, it may not make sense
to increase the bound.

<a name="maxconstraintsolvermemory"></a>
## MaxConstraintSolverMemory

The number of Megabytes that the 
[constraint solver](input-generation.md#constraint-solver)
has to calculate inputs that will cause a new and 
different execution path to be taken. This is an 
option of the **PexSettingsAttributeBase** and its 
derived types.

The deeper IntelliTest explores the execution paths 
of a program, the more complex the constraint systems
that IntelliTest builds from the control-flow and 
data-flow of the program become. Depending on the 
available memory of your computer, you can set this 
value to allow IntelliTest to tackle more complex 
constraint systems.

Typically, the reason for a timeout is that 
IntelliTest is trying to find a solution for a 
constraint system that does not have a solution, 
but it is not aware of this fact. Since this is the 
most common cause of an out-of-memory situation, it 
may not make sense to increase the bound.

<a name="maxbranches"></a>
## MaxBranches

The maximum number of branches that may be taken 
along a single execution path.

The motivation behind this exploration bound is to 
limit the length of any execution path that 
IntelliTest explores during 
[input generation](input-generation.md). In particular,
it prevents IntelliTest from becoming unresponsive
if the program goes into an infinite loop.

Each conditional and unconditional branch of the 
executed and monitored code is counted towards this 
limit, including branches which do not depend on the 
inputs of the parameterized test.

For example, the following code consumes branches in 
of the order 100:

```
for (int i=0; i<100; i++) { }
```

<a name="maxcalls"></a>
## MaxCalls

The maximum number of calls that may be made during a
single execution path.

The motivation behind this exploration bound is to 
limit the length of any execution path that 
IntelliTest explores during 
[input generation](input-generation.md). In particular,
it prevents IntelliTest from becoming unresponsive
if the program calls a method recursively an infinite
number of times, which would cause a stack overflow 
that IntelliTest cannot recover from.

Each call (direct, indirect, virtual, jump) of the 
executed and monitored code is counted towards this 
limit.

<a name="maxstack"></a>
## MaxStack

The maximum size of the stack at any time during a 
single execution path, measured by the number of 
active call frames.

The motivation behind this exploration bound is to 
limit the size of the stack of any execution path 
that IntelliTest explores during 
[input generation](input-generation.md). In particular,
it prevents IntelliTest from using all available 
stack space, which would cause a stack overflow that 
IntelliTest cannot recover from.

<a name="maxconditions"></a>
## MaxConditions

The emaximum number of conditions over the inputs 
that may be checked during a single execution path.

The motivation behind this exploration bound is to 
limit the complexity of any execution path that 
IntelliTest explores during 
[input generation](input-generation.md). Each 
conditional branch that depends on the inputs of the 
parameterized test is counted towards this limit.

For example, each path in the following code consumes
n+1 conditions:

```
[PexMethod]
void ParameterizedTest(int n) 
{
     for (int i=0; i<n; i++) { // conditions are "0<n", "1<n", ..., "!(n<n)"
          ...
     }
     for (int i=0; i<100; i++) { // irrelevant for MaxConditions, since conditions do not depend on input
          ...
     }
}
```

<a name="maxruns"></a>
## MaxRuns

Th emaximum number of runs that IntelliTest will try 
during the exploration of a test.

The motivation behind this exploration bound is that 
any code which contains loops or recursion might have
an infinite number of execution paths, and thus 
IntelliTest needs to be limited during 
[input generation](input-generation.md). 

The two settings **MaxRuns** and **MaxRunsWithUniquePaths**
are related as follows: 

* IntelliTest will call a parameterized test method 
  up to **MaxRuns** times with different test inputs.
* If the executed code is deterministic, IntelliTest
  will take a different execution path each time. 
  However, under some conditions the executed code 
  might follow an execution path it has already 
  taken before, with different inputs. 
* IntelliTest counts how many unique execution paths 
  it finds; this number is limited by the 
  **MaxRunsWithUniquePaths** option.

<a name="maxrunswithoutnewtests"></a>
## MaxRunsWithoutNewTests

The maximum number of consecutive runs without a new 
test being emitted.

While IntelliTest can often find many interesting 
test inputs within a short time, after a while 
it will not find any more new test inputs and will 
emit no more unit tests. This configuration option 
places a bound on the number of consecutive attempts 
IntelliTest may perform without emitting a new test. 
When reached, it will halt the exploration. 

<a name="maxrunswithuniquepaths"></a>
## MaxRunsWithUniquePaths

The maximum number of unique paths that IntelliTest 
will consider during an exploration.

The motivation behind this exploration bound is that 
any code containing loops or recursion might have an 
infinite number of execution paths, and so IntelliTest
must be limited during 
[input generation](input-generation.md).

The two settings **MaxRuns** and **MaxRunsWithUniquePaths**
are related as follows: 

* IntelliTest will call a parameterized test method 
  up to **MaxRuns** times with different test inputs.
* If the executed code is deterministic, IntelliTest
  will take a different execution path each time. 
  However, under some conditions the executed code 
  might follow an execution path it has already 
  taken before, with different inputs. 
* IntelliTest counts how many unique execution paths 
  it finds; this number is limited by the 
  **MaxRunsWithUniquePaths** option.

<a name="maxexceptions"></a>
## MaxExceptions

The maximum number of exceptions that can be 
encountered before exploration is halted.

The motivation behind this exploration bound is to 
stop the exploration of code that contains many bugs.
If IntelliTest finds too many errors in the code, 
exploration is stopped.

<a name="testexcludepathboundsexceeded"></a>
## TestExcludePathBoundsExceeded

Execution paths that exceed the configured path 
bounds [MaxCalls](#maxcalls), [MaxBranches](#maxbranches), 
[MaxStack](#maxstack), and [MaxConditions](#maxconditions) are ignored.

The motivation behind this exploration bound is to 
deal with (most likely) non-terminating tests. When 
IntelliTest reaches an exploration bound such as
[MaxCalls](#maxcalls), [MaxBranches](#maxbranches), 
[MaxStack](#maxstack), or [MaxConditions](#maxconditions),
it assumes that the test will not be a non-terminating
process, and will not cause a stack overflow later on.
Such test cases may pose problems to other test 
frameworks, and this attribute provides a way to 
prevent IntelliTest from emitting test cases for 
potentially non-terminating processes or test cases
that will cause a stack overflow.

<a name="testemissionfilter"></a>
## TestEmissionFilter

Indicates the types of tests that IntelliTest should 
emit. The possible values are:

* **All** - Emit tests for everything, including assumption violations.
* **FailuresAndIncreasedBranchHits** (the default) - Emit tests for all unique failures, and whenever a test case increases coverage as controlled by [TestEmissionBranchHits](#testemissionbranchhits).
* **FailuresAndUniquePaths** - Emit tests for all failures IntelliTest finds, and also for each test input that causes a unique execution path.
* **Failures** - Emit tests for failures only.

<a name="testemissionbranchhits"></a>
## TestEmissionBranchHits

Depending on the current 
[TestEmissionFilter](#testemissionfilter) setting, 
IntelliTest emits new test cases when they cover a 
branch in the program that was not covered before.

The **TestEmissionBranchHits** setting determines 
if IntelliTest should just consider whether a branch 
was covered at all (**TestEmissionBranchHits=1**), 
if a test covered it either once or twice 
(**TestEmissionBranchHits=2**), and so on.

**TestEmissionBranchHits=1** will produce a very 
small test suite that will cover all branches 
IntelliTest could reach. In particular, this test 
suite will also cover all basic blocks and statements
it reached. 

The default for this option is 
**TestEmissionBranchHits=2**, which generates a more 
expressive test suite that is also better suited to 
detecting future regression errors.

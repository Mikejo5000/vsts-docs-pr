# Azure Boards get started  

Use this guide to sign up and start using Azure Boards. 

Start with [Sign up and invite some teammates](sign-up-invite-teammates.md).

Then, read [Plan and track work](plan-track-work.md) to get familiar with work items and work item types.

Next, to plan your work, see [Create your backlog](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md?toc=/vsts/work/get-started/toc.json&bc=/vsts/work/get-started/breadcrumb/toc.json ) or [Use Kanban boards](../kanban/kanban-quickstart.md?toc=/vsts/work/get-started/toc.json&bc=/vsts/work/get-started/breadcrumb/toc.json )

Other resources to get you up and running: 

- Understand working within the web portal, see [Navigation Basics](../../project/navigation/index.md)  
- Understand permissions, access, and security, see [Security & Identity](../../organizations/security/index.md)  
- Understand how to scale and how to add additional Agile tools, see [About projects and scaling your organization](../../organizations/projects/about-projects.md)

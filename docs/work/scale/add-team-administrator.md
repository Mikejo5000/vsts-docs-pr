It's always a good idea to have more than one person with administration permissions for an area. 

1. If you're not a team administrator, get added as one using this procedure. Ask an administrator for your team project or project collection to add you as an administrator.  

2. Add an administrator from the web portal team admin context.

	To access this page, choose the ![gear icon](../_img/icons/gear_icon.png) gear icon from your team home page.  

3. Add the account identity.

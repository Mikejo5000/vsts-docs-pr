# Kanban basics

<b>Team Services | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013</b> 

To maximize a team's ability to consistently deliver high quality software, Kanban emphasize two main practices. The first, visualize the flow of work, requires you to map your team's workflow stages and configure your Kanban board to match. The second, constrain the amount of work in progress, requires you to set work-in-progress (WIP) limits. You're then ready to track progress on your Kanban board and monitor key metrics to reduce lead or cycle time.  

Your Kanban board turns your backlog into an interactive signboard, providing a visual flow of work. As work progresses from idea to completion, you update the items on the board. Each column represents a work stage, and each card represents a user story (blue cards) or a bug (red cards) at that stage of work.  


### Open your Kanban board from the web portal

You access your Kanban board from the **Work>Backlogs>Board** page. If you don't have a team project yet, create one in [Visual Studio Team Services](../../setup-admin/team-services/set-up-vs.md) or set one up in an [on-premises TFS](../../setup-admin/create-team-project.md).   

To contribute to the Kanban board, you must be a member of the team and belong to the Contributors group. To configure the Kanban board, you must be added to the team administrator role or be a member of the Project Administrators group.   If you don't have access to the team project, [get invited to the team](../scale/multiple-teams.md#add-team-members).

To view your Kanban board, click the **Board** link from the **Work>Backlogs** page. 

<img src="_img/kanban-basics-intro.png" alt="Kanban board, Agile template" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />  

-->

>[!NOTE]  
>Your Kanban board is one of two types of boards available to you. For an overview of the features supported on each backlog and board, see [Backlogs, boards, and plans](../backlogs-boards-plans.md). To switch to the [product backlog](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md), click **Backlog**. And, to switch to the [Task board](../scrum/task-board.md), click on the current iteration or other sprint of interest. If no sprints appear, see [Schedule sprints](../scrum/define-sprints.md). 

User stories and bugs correspond to types of work items. You use  [work items](../backlogs/add-work-items.md) to share information, assign work to team members, update status, track dependencies, and more.

<!--- 
You open your Kanban board using one of these URLs that connects you to your team project:   

**Team Services**:  ```http://AccountName/DefaultCollection/TeamProjectName/_backlogs/board/ ```

**On-premises Team Foundation Server (TFS)**:  ```http://ServerName:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/TeamProjectName/_backlogs/board/```

If you don't have a team project yet, create one in [Visual Studio Team Services](../../setup-admin/team-services/set-up-vs.md) or set one up in an [on-premises TFS](../../setup-admin/create-team-project.md). If you don't have access to the team project, get [invited to the team](../scale/multiple-teams.md#add-team-members).

<a id="add-or-rename-columns"> </a>

## 1. Map the flow of how your team works, add or rename columns
<meta name="description" content="Kanban workflow" />
Kanban literally means signboard or billboard. As a first step, you customize your board to map to how your team works.

When you first open your Kanban board, you'll see one column for each [workflow state](../concepts/workflow-and-state-categories.md). Your actual columns vary based on the [process](../guidance/choose-process.md) chosen to create your team project.

For user stories, the New, Active, Resolved, and Closed states track progress from idea to completion.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr valign="top">
<td>
![User story workflow states](_img/ALM_KB_Workflow.png)


</td>
<td>
![Default kanban board, Agile template](_img/ALM_KB_Empty.png)



</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

However, your team's workflow stages most likely don't map to these default states. For your team to have a functional board they must identify the stages of their workflow process and then configure the board to match.

For example, you can change your Kanban columns to map to the following five workflow stages.

![Kanban board, Columns customized](_img/ALM_KB_Board2.png)

Once you've identified your stages, simply add and rename columns to map to them. Keep the number of columns to a minimum while still representing the key handoffs that occur for your team.

## 2. Set WIP limits to constrain work in progress
<meta name="description" content="Kanban WIP limits" />
In this next step, your team sets WIP limits for each workflow stage. While setting WIP limits is easy, adhering to them takes a team commitment. Teams new to Kanban may find WIP limits counterintuitive and uncomfortable. However, this single practice has helped teams identify bottlenecks, improve their process, and increase the quality of software they ship.

What limits should you set? Start with numbers that don't exceed 2 or 3 items per team member working within a stage. Respecting WIP limits means teams don't pull items into a column if doing so causes the number of items in the column to exceed the WIP limit.

When they do exceed the limit, the column count displays red. Teams can use this as a signal to focus immediately on activities to bring the number of items in the column down.

![Exceeded WIP Limits](_img/ALM_KB_WipLimits.png)

Set WIP limits based on team discussions and revisit as your team identifies ways to improve their processes. Use WIP limits to identify bottlenecks and eliminate waste from your work flow processes. For guidance, see [WIP limits](wip-limits.md).

1. From your Kanban board, click ![settings icon](../_img/icons/team-settings-gear-icon.png) and as needed, click Columns.  

	<img src="../customize/_img/kanban-card-customize-open-settings.png" alt="Kanban board, open common configuration settings" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />
	
	If you're not a team admin, [get added as one](../scale/add-team-administrator.md). Only team and project admins can customize columns.

	You'll see different column titles and choices based on the following:
	
	- You connect to Visual Studio Team Services or an on-premises TFS
	- The [Process](../guidance/choose-process.md) you used to create your team project  
	- Whether your team has chosen to [treat bugs like requirements or like tasks](../customize/show-bugs-on-backlog.md)  

	**Team Services and TFS 2015.1 and later versions**  
2. Click a column tab to set the WIP limit for that column.  

	<img src="_img/wip-columns-settings.png" alt="Kanban board, Customize columns, default columns, Agile process, set WIP limits" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" /> 

	Go to [Kanban basics](kanban-basics.md) for information about accessing your Kanban board. And, if you're not a team admin, [get added as one](../scale/add-team-administrator.md). Only team and project admins can customize columns.  

	**TFS 2015**   
	Set the WIP limits for each intermediate column.

<a id="track-work">  </a>
## 3. Track work in progress, update status via drag-and-drop
<meta name="description" content="Kanban tools track progress" />
Once you've configured your Kanban board to match how your team works, you're ready to use it.

Here are a few things you can do. See at a glance the estimated size of work for each item which displays at the bottom right of each card. Add items to your backlog in the first column. When priorities change, move items up and down within a column. And, as work completes in one stage, update the status of an item by dragging and dropping it to a downstream stage.

![Kanban board, move an item](_img/ALM_CC_MoveCard.png)

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b> You can [reorder items within a column](#reorder-cards) from Team Services and the web portal for TFS 2015.1 and later versions.   

Also, you can quickly update a field or reassign ownership directly from the board.

![Kanban, assign items](_img/ALM_CC_UpdateFieldOnCard.png)

Updating your Kanban board as work progresses helps keep you and your team in sync. Also, you'll be able to see and share the value stream your team is delivering to customers.

## 4. Monitor metrics and fine tune
As with most Agile practices, Kanban encourages monitoring key metrics to fine tune your processes. After your team has used the Kanban board for several weeks, check out your Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD).

<img src="_img/ALM_KB_Board5.png" alt="Open the cumulative flow diagram" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />   

The CFD shows the count of items in each Kanban column for the past 30 weeks or less. From this chart you can gain an idea of the amount of work in progress and lead time. Work in progress counts unfinished requirements. Lead time indicates the amount of time it takes to complete a requirement once work has started.  

<img src="_img/ALM_KB_CumulativeFlow.png" alt="Kanban board, cumulative flow diagram" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />   

By monitoring these metrics, you can gain insight into how to optimize your processes and minimize lead time. For additional guidance, see [Cumulative Flow](../../report/guidance/cumulative-flow.md) 
 
>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b>From Team Services, you can also add the [Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)](../../report/guidance/cumulative-flow.md) and [Lead Time and Cycle Time](../../report/guidance/cycle-time-and-lead-time.md)  widgets to a team dashboard.  



## Related notes

Each team can manage their backlog and customize their Kanban board. [Add teams](../scale/multiple-teams.md) when you assign specific feature areas to different teams for development. Each team can then manage their backlog and focus on how they will develop their deliverables. 

Here are some useful tips when working with the Kanban board:
- To quickly assign items to a team member, add the Assign To field to display on the cards (see [Customize cards](../customize/customize-cards.md))   
- Customize cards to show the fields you most care about  
- Add a swimlane to track high-priority work or track work which falls into different service level agreements (see [Swimlanes](expedite-work.md))   
- Highlight specific work items by color coding cards based on a field value or tag (see [Customize cards](../customize/customize-cards.md)) 
- If you use Scrumban, drag-and-drop cards onto a sprint to quickly assign them to a sprint.  



If your new to Team Services or TFS and want to understand what you can customize, see [Customize your work tracking experience](../customize/customize-work.md).

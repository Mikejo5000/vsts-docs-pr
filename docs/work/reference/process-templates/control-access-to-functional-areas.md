# Control access to functional areas

[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](../../_shared/dev15-version-header-process-template.md)]

You can configure the initial security settings for the following functional areas for a team project: 
- Work item queries
- Team Foundation version control (TFVC) 
- Team Foundation Build
- Visual Studio Lab Management. 
 
The default process templates assign several permissions to default security groups. You can modify these assignments by customizing the plug-in file for the corresponding functional area.  
  
For information about how to configure initial security groups, see [Configure initial groups, teams, members, and permissions](configure-initial-groups-teams-members-permissions.md). For information about how to administer users and groups, see [Set up groups for use in TFS](../../../setup-admin/tfs/admin/setup-ad-groups.md).  
  
<a name="ElementsFunctionalArea"></a> 
##Assign permissions to functional areas  
 You can use the functional **permission** element to allow or deny permissions for functional areas to a security group in Team Foundation Server, a Windows group, or a Windows identity. You use this element in the plug-in files for work item tracking, Team Foundation version control, Team Foundation Build, and Lab Management. You must encapsulate the permission element within its corresponding container: the **permissions** element. You use the following syntax structure for the functional **permission** element:  
  
```  
<permission allow="PermissionName" identity="GroupName"/>  
<permission deny="PermissionName" identity="GroupName"/>  
<permission allow="PermissionName" deny="PermissionName" identity="GroupName"/>  
```  
  
 The following table describes the attributes for the functional **permission** element:  
  
|**Attribute**|**Description**|  
|-------------------|---------------------|  
|**allow**|Identifies the permissions that are granted. You specify permissions as comma-delimited text.<br /><br /> For the names of the permissions that have been defined for each functional area, see the following sections later in this topic:<br /><br /> -   [Assign TFVC permissions](#VersionControl)<br />-   [Assign Build permissions](#Build)<br />-   [Assign Lab Management permissions](#LabManagement)|  
|**deny**|Identifies the permissions that are revoked. You specify permissions as comma-delimited text. **Note:**  Denied permissions take precedence over allowed permissions.|  
|**identity**|Specifies the security group in Team Foundation Server, the Windows group, or the Windows identity to which the permissions are applied. For the format to use when you specify groups, see "Default Groups Defined in Team Foundation Server" in [Configure initial groups, teams, members, and permissions](configure-initial-groups-teams-members-permissions.md).|  
  
 The following example shows how to grant permissions to allow the **Contributors** group to view builds and build definitions and to queue builds and edit build quality.  
  
```  
<taskXml>  
   <permission allow="Read, PendChange, Checkin, Label, Lock" identity="[$$PROJECTNAME$$]\Contributors"/>  
</taskXml>  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  During runtime, if a permission can't be found for an identity, the permission is searched for in any other groups to which the identity belongs. If the permission cannot be found, the permission is denied by default.  
  
<a name="Queries"></a> 
##  Assign permissions for work item queries  
In the workitems plug-in file, you can assign permissions that control access to team query folders. Query folder permissions are specific to queries and query folders. You can grant access to users and groups in Windows or to default TFS groups.  
  
 You assign these permissions by using the functional **permission** element, as the following example shows:  
  
```  
<Permission allow="Read, Contribute, Delete, ManagePermissions, FullControl" identity="="[$$PROJECTNAME$$]\$$PROJECTADMINGROUP$$" />  
  
```  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  After the team project is created, you can set permissions by right-clicking a query folder or query. For details, see [Set permissions on queries](../../track/set-query-permissions.md).  
  
The following table describes the permissions that control access to query folders and queries. It also indicates the default assignments that are made in the default process templates. By default, the creators or owners of queries and query folders have full control of managing the queries that they created or own.  
  
|Permission|Description|Readers, Contributors, Builders|Creator Owners, Project Administrator Group, Project Collection Administrators|  
|----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|**Read**|**Read**. Can view and run a query or view a query folder and its contents|![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|  
|**Contribute**|**Contribute**. Can view and edit a query or query folder and its contents||![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|  
|**Delete**|**Delete**. Can view, edit, and delete a query or query folder and its contents||![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|

|**FullControl**|**Full Control**. Can view, edit, delete, and manage permissions for a query or query folder and its contents||![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|  
  
<a name="VersionControl"></a> 
##  Assign TFVC permissions 
You can assign permissions that control access to source code files and folders by changing the plug-in file for version control. Version control permissions are specific to source code files and folders. You can grant access to users and groups in Windows or TFS default groups.  
  
You assign these permissions by using the functional **permission** element, as the following example shows:  
  
```  
<permission allow="Read, PendChange, Checkin, Label, Lock, Merge" identity="[$$PROJECTNAME$$]\@@Contributors@@" />  
```  
 
The following table describes the permissions that control access to source code files and folders. It also indicates the default assignments that are made in the default process templates.  
  
|**Permission**|**Description**|Readers|Contributors|Builders|Project Administrator Group|  
|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------------------|  
|**Read**|**Read**. Can display the contents of a file or folder.<br /><br /> If a user has **Read** permissions for a folder but not the files that it contains, the user can display the names and properties of those files, but the user cannot open them.|![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|  
|**PendChange**|**Check out**. Can check out and make a pending change to an item. Examples of pending changes include adding, editing, renaming, deleting, undeleting, branching, and merging a file.||![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|

|**ManageBranch**|**Manage branch**. Users who have this permission for a given path can convert any folder under that path into a branch. Users who have this permission for a branch can also edit its properties, re-parent it, and convert it to a folder.<br /><br /> Users who have this permission can branch this branch only if they also have the **Merge** permission for the target path. Users cannot create branches from a branch for which they do not have the **Manage Branch** permission.||||![check mark](_img/icon_witcheckgreen.png "Icon_WITcheckgreen")|  
  
<a name="Build"></a> 
##  Assign Build permissions    
You can assign permissions that control access to build activities by changing the Build plug-in file. You can grant access to users and groups in Windows and groups in Team Foundation Server. For information about the format to use when you specify groups, see [Group macros and default groups ](configure-initial-groups-teams-members-permissions.md#GroupMacros).  
  
 You assign these permissions by using the functional **permission** element, as the following example shows:  
  
```  
<Permission allow="ViewBuildDefinition, QueueBuilds, ViewBuilds, EditBuildQuality" identity="[$$PROJECTNAME$$]\@@Contributors@@" />  
```  
 
  
 The following table describes the permissions that you can assign that control access to the build functions of a team project. The table also indicates the default assignments that are made in the default process templates.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **Override check-in validation by build** permission should be assigned only to service accounts for build services and to build administrators who are responsible for the quality of the code. For more information, see [Perform a gated check-in](../../../tfvc/check-folder-controlled-by-gated-check-build-process.md).

##Assign Lab Management permissions

You can control access to activities in Lab Management by changing the Lab plug-in file. Permissions for Lab Management are specific to virtual machines, environments, and other resources. You can grant access to users and groups in Windows and TFS groups. You assign these permissions by using the functional **permission** element, as the following example shows:  
  
```  
<permission allow="Read, Create, Write, Edit, Start, Stop, ManageSnapshots, Pause" identity="[$$PROJECTNAME$$]\@@Contributors@@" />  
```  

  
 The following table describes the permissions that you can assign to control access to Visual Studio Lab Management. The table also indicates the default assignments that are made in the default process templates.

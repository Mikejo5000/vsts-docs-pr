# Process template and plug-in files


[!INCLUDEÂ [temp](../../_shared/dev15-version-header-process-template.md)]


You customize the initial configuration of team projects by customizing one or more process template files. You can customize several types of template files, which include the root XML file, plug-in files, and XML definition files. By customizing these files, you can define the initial configuration of all team projects that are created from the process template.  
  
For information about the default process templates, see [Choose a process](../../guidance/choose-process.md). To learn about customizing a process template, see [Customize a process template](customize-process.md).  
   

<a name="client-support"></a> 
## Client support for team project creation

When you choose to create a team project, the Project Creation Wizard (PCW) reads the root process template file and its specified plug-in files defined within the process or process template you select. These files define the tasks and the screens that appear when the PCW is run. (No screens appear when you create a team project from the web portal.)   

For example, if a process template includes the plug-in for Windows SharePoint Services, then a screen appears that requests information about the project portal. 

Depending on whether you work from the cloud or an on-premises server, you can create a team project from one of the following clients.

| Client | Team Services | On-premises TFS | 
|--------|---------------|-----------------| 
|Visual Studio| ![not supported](../../_img/icons/delete_icon.png) | ![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png)|
|Team Explorer| ![not supported](../../_img/icons/delete_icon.png) | ![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png) |
|Web portal | ![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png)| ![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png) |

(![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png)- Supported; ![not supported](../../_img/icons/delete_icon.png) - Not supported)  

>[!NOTE]  
>For Team Services, even if you initiate creating a team project from Visual Studio or Team Explorer, you'll be taken to the web portal to complete the operation.  

When you create a team project from the web portal, there are several plug-ins that aren't supported. They are simply ignored by the PCW. For details, review [Plug-in file descriptions and PCW support](#PlugInFiles).   

  
<a name="Root"></a> 
##  The root process template file  
 You customize the root XML file, ProcessTemplate.xml, to define the sequence of plug-in files to be processed and the dependencies of each plug-in. The ProcessTemplate.xml file contains all task groups that must run to successfully create a team project. Each task group references a subordinate XML plug-in file (often in a subfolder) where the specific tasks are defined. For more information, see [Define the root tasks](define-root-tasks-process-template-plug-in.md).  
   
 
<a name="PlugInFiles"></a> 
## Plug-in files 

Each plug-in file configures a specific functional area by defining one or more tasks. Tasks specify to upload a file, set permissions for a group, or configure some other functional area.  

For example, the Work Item Tracking plug-in configures the work item types, queries, categories, and process configuration for a new team project. 

## Plug-in file descriptions and PCW support  

Each default process template includes the plug-in files described in the following table. The order in which the plug-ins are called is determined by the root process template file. Except for the Classification plug-in, plug-ins can also be deleted from the process template.  

All plug-ins are supported (![supported](../../_img/icons/checkmark.png)) when you create your team project from a supported client. However, when you create the team project from the cloud or the web portal for an on-premises TFS, several plug-ins are ignored or not supported (![not supported](../../_img/icons/delete_icon.png)) as indicated in the following table.

## Related notes

The schema definition for process templates uses a mix of camel-case and all capitalized elements. If you encounter errors when validating your type definition files, check the case structure of your elements. Also, the case structure of opening and closing tags must match according to the rules for XML syntax. See [Process template plug-ins: Index to XML element definitions](process-template-plug-ins-xml-elements-index.md).

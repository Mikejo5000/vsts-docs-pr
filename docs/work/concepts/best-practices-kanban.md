# Kanban best practices

<b>Team Services | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | TFS 2013</b> 

Having worked through the four [Kanban basics](../kanban/kanban-basics.md) steps, you're well on your way to implementing most of Kanban's six core practices.

1. **Visualize your workflow**. Teams track their work using a Kanban board that maps to how they work. Teams discuss how to best focus their resources to deliver the most important work.
2. **Limit work in progress**. Teams set and adhere to WIP limits they set for each stage of work. They use WIP limits to maintain focus on completing what they started and to identify bottlenecks occurring in their processes.
3. **Manage flow**. Teams monitor the overall work in progress and lead time, which gives them an idea of the speed of their delivery.
4. **Make policies explicit**. Teams spell out the standards and processes they agree to follow and make them readily accessible. For example, by making the team's Definition of Done for each work stage explicit, they can avoid wasted time and effort.
5. **Create opportunities for feedback**. Teams meet periodically to reflect on what's working and what needs improvement.
6. **Improve collaboratively, evolve experimentally**. Teams determine how to improve the continuous flow of delivery over time based of key metrics. They involve the entire team to gather insights and ideas. And, when persistent bottlenecks arise, they determine the changes that will alleviate them.

Over time, Kanban can provide your team insight as to how well their current processes work end-to-end and how to improve them. Incremental adoption of Kanban practices tends to yield greater success and builds on the sixth practice, to evolve experimentally. These practices arose from principles of Lean Manufacturing and Systems Thinking.

# Agile tools that rely on areas or iterations

## Structure teams, areas, and iterations to support hierarchical teams or scale agility within an enterprise 

Although there is no concept of sub-teams, you can create teams whose area paths are under another team, which effectively creates a hierarchy of teams. To learn more, see [Add another team](../scale/multiple-teams.md).

Also, these topics can walk you through the steps for configuring teams, area paths, and iterations to support portfolio management or enterprise organizations: [Portfolio management](../scale/portfolio-management.md) and [Implement Scaled Agile Framework to support epics, release trains, and multiple backlogs](../scale/scaled-agile-framework.md).

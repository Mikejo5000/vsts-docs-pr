# About Agile tools and Agile project management 

You build your project plan by creating a backlog of work items that represent the features, requirements, user stories, or other work to perform.  Different types of work items help you track different types of work, such as user stories, tasks, bugs, issues, and more. 

[![Define stories](_img/gs-planning-define-stories.png)](./backlogs/create-your-backlog.md)[![Organize backlog](_img/gs-planning-organize-backlog.png)](./backlogs/organize-backlog.md)[![Manage bugs](_img/gs-planning-manage-bugs.png)](./backlogs/manage-bugs.md)[![Manage issues](_img/gs-planning-manage-issues.png)](./backlogs/manage-issues-impediments.md)


## Scrum method and tools 
The Scrum method uses sprints to plan work to perform by a team within a specific time period and cadence. To get started, several sprints are predefined for your team.  If you're new to Scrum, get an overview from [What is Scrum?](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/what-is-scrum/). 

[![Schedule sprints](_img/gs-planning-define-sprints.png)](./scrum/define-sprints.md)[![Plan a sprint](_img/gs-planning-plan-sprint.png)](./scrum/sprint-planning.md)[![Monitor sprint progress](_img/gs-planning-monitor-sprint.png)](./scrum/task-board.md)[![Forecast](_img/gs-planning-forecast.png)](./scrum/velocity-and-forecasting.md)


## Kanban method and tools
Kanban uses a visual interactive board to plan and show progress using cards. Your Kanban board is fully customizable to support the workflow used by your team.  

[![Configure Kanban board](_img/gs-planning-configure-kanban.png)](./kanban/kanban-basics.md)[![Update the Kanban board](_img/gs-planning-track-kanban.png)](./kanban/kanban-basics.md)[![Monitor progress](_img/gs-planning-monitor-kanban.png)](../Report/guidance/cumulative-flow.md)

You update the status of work by dragging card to another column on the Kanban board. You can even change the order of items as you move a card to a new column.

## Scale: Manage work across the enterprise

How do you manage work across the enterprise using Agile tools?  How will you scale your Agile tools to support your growing enterprise?  

You can scale your system as needed by adding teams and/or team projects. These can be created within the single account or collection. As your organization grows, your tools can grow to support a [culture of team autonomy as well as organizational alignment](./scale/agile-culture.md).

To learn more, see the following topics:  

- [Scale Agile to large teams](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/scale-agile-large-teams/)
- [Add and structure teams](./scale/multiple-teams.md) and organize work to gain the best of both worlds: team autonomy and organizational alignment. Teams can manage their work independently of one another.  
- [Configure team settings and add team administrators](./scale/manage-team-assets.md). 
- Manage a [portfolio of backlogs](./scale/portfolio-management.md) and gain insight into each team's progress as well as the progress of all programs.

- Incrementally adopt [practices that scale](./scale/practices-that-scale.md) to create greater rhythm and flow within your organization, engage customers, improve project visibility, and develop a productive workforce.
- Structure team projects to gain [visibility across teams](./scale/visibility-across-teams.md) or to support [epics, release trains, and multiple backlogs to support the Scaled Agile Framework](./scale/scaled-agile-framework.md). 
- Use [Delivery plans](./scale/review-team-plans.md) to review the schedule of stories or features your teams plan to deliver. Delivery plans show the scheduled work items by sprint (iteration path) of selected teams against a calendar view.

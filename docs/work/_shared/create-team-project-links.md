Before you start tracking work, you must have a team project. To create one hosted in the cloud, see [Sign up for Visual Studio Team Services](../../setup-admin/team-services/sign-up-for-visual-studio-team-services.md). To create one hosted on an on-premises TFS, see [Create a team project](../../setup-admin/create-team-project.md).   

If you have a team project, start tracking work:  

-   [Get started planning and tracking work](../agile-project-management.md) - for an overview of planning activities and tools  
-   [Add work items to manage a project](../backlogs/add-work-items.md) - to gain more familiarity with the work item form features  
-   [Create a backlog](../backlogs/create-your-backlog.md) - to develop your product backlog   
-   [Plan a sprint](../scrum/sprint-planning.md)  - to start working in Scrum    
-   [Kanban](../kanban/kanban-basics.md)  - to start working in Kanban  
-   [Excel](../office/bulk-add-modify-work-items-excel.md) or [Project](../office/create-your-backlog-tasks-using-project.md) - to create a work breakdown structure

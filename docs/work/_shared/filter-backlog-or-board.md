### Filter backlogs, boards, and queries 
 
If you have many items listed in your product or portfolio backlog, Kanban board, or query results&mdash;and you want to focus on a subset of them&mdash;you can filter the set.  

#### Filter based on keywords  
You can use keywords to filter your backlogs, Kanban boards, and query results. The filter function picks up work items based on any visible/displayed column or field, including tags, based on the keyword that you enter. Also, you can enter a value for an ID, whether or not the ID field is visible.  

Here, we filter the backlog to only show items that include 'Web' in any one of the displayed column fields.

The filtered set is always a flat list, even if you've selected to show parents.  

The filter criteria ignores the following characters when the field value starts with the character: ```{, (, [, !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, ~, `, ', "```.  

#### Filter based on tags  
If you've [added tags to your work items](../track/add-tags-to-work-items.md), you can filter your backlogs, Kanban boards, and query results using the ![tag filter icon](../_img/icons/tag_filter_icon.png) tag filter. For backlogs and query results, add Tags as a column option prior to filtering on tags.  

To filter the Kanban board using tags, make sure that you first [customize cards to Show tags](../customize/customize-cards.md). See also, [Filter the Kanban board](../kanban/filter-kanban-board.md) for additional options.

>[!TIP]  
>To access the latest versions of the default processes/process templates:
>- **For the Inheritance process model (Team Services) or the On-premises  XML process model (on-premises TFS)**:   
	><ul><li>[Install or upgrade to the latest version of TFS](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#team-foundation-server-2017).</li> 
	><li>Download the zipped template file using the [Process Template Manager](../guidance/manage-process-templates.md). You'll need to use a version of Visual Studio that is at the same version level as TFS. You can install the latest version of [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#visual-studio-community-2015-with-update-3-free) for free.</li>
	><li>You can access the latest versions of the default process templates installed on TFS 2017 here: %programfiles%/Microsoft Team Foundation Server 15.0/Tools/Deploy/ProcessTemplateManagerFiles/1033 (for TFS 2015, the main folder is Microsoft Team Foundation Server 14.0). For descriptions of each file and folder, see [Overview of process template files](../reference/process-templates/overview-process-template-files.md).</li></ul>
>- **For Hosted XML process model**: Open the Process page from the account settings admin context, and choose the Export option from the actions menu of a default process. To learn more, see [Manage processes](../process/manage-process.md).

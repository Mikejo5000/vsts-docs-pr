>When the new form roll out is enabled, the XML definitions for all work item types (WITs) in the collection are updated to include a **WebLayout** section within the **FORM** section. 
>
>The new form makes available several new features as described in [New work item experience](../process/new-work-item-experience.md). Your account or project collection administrator manages the [switch to the new form](../customize/manage-new-form-rollout.md).<br/>
> - For the [Inheritance process model](../process/manage-process.md), the switch to the new form is automatic for all user accounts.  
> - For  the [Hosted XML process model](../import-process/import-process.md), an admin must [enable the new form](../customize/manage-new-form-rollout.md). <br/>
> - For TFS 2017, the new form is automatically available when you add team projects to a new collection. For existing team projects, an admin must [enable the new form](../customize/manage-new-form-rollout.md). <br/>
> - For TFS 2015 the new form isn't available. You must [upgrade to TFS 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#team-foundation-server-2017) to access the new form.

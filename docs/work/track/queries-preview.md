# New Queries experience

**VSTS**   

>[!NOTE]    
><b>Feature availability: </b>The New queries experience is in preview for VSTS and available when you enable it from the web portal.     

We have launched a preview version of a modernized Queries Hub in your VSTS account. You can enable it from the [Preview features menu](../../collaborate/preview-features.md) that you access from your account profile.

## User focused navigation
When you enable the preview of the **Work>Queries** hub, youâ€™ll notice that the left pane is gone. To navigate quickly between your favorite queries, use the dropdown in the query title.

Alternatively, browse all your personal and shared queries in the new directory pages and favorite what is important to you. You can get to the query directory using the "Queries" breadcrumb.

In addition the directory pages highlight new metadata for each query including:
    * The type of query
    * The path within the hierarchy
    * Who last modified it
    * When it was last modified

## Find queries faster with filtering
The query directory pages now include a filter bar that lets you quickly search for any query you care about.

## Other improvements
Besides the big changes listed above, here are some other improvements:
* Create and edit followed work item queries with the @Follows macro
* "Save as" now copies charts to the new query
* Compact command bar and expanded quick filter capabilities

## What's next?
We plan to continue to invest in the Queries Hub beyond the new features in this preview. Some things to look forward to include:
* Simplified column configuration experience
* Expanded query filtering capabilities to filter by folders

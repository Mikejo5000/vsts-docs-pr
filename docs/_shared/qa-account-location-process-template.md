####Q: How do I change my team project name, account location, or process? 

A:	Change these when you sign up for your Team Services account.

Team Services uses Agile as the default 
[process](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/vs/alm/Work/guidance/choose-process) 
to organize your work. And your account's default location is based on the closest 
[Microsoft Azure region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions) 
where Team Services is available. For a better experience, 
select a location that's closest to most users in your account. 
You can select another process, like Scrum, if that works best for you.

If you connected your Team Services account to an organization's directory in Azure Active Directory, 
but you belong to multiple directories and want to select a different directory, 
change your directory here:

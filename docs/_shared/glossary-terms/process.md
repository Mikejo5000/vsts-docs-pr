## Process
Defines the building blocks of the work tracking system. To customize a process, you first create an inherited process from one of the default system processes&mdash;[Agile](/vsts/boards/work-items/guidance/agile-process.md), [Scrum](/vsts/boards/work-items/guidance/scrum-process.md), or [CMMI](/vsts/boards/work-items/guidance/cmmi-process.md). Changes you make to a process are seen by all projects that use it. Learn more: [About process customization and inherited processes](/vsts/organizations/settings/work/inheritance-process-model.md).

#### Q: Can a user who has paid for Basic access join other VSTS organizations?

A: No, a user can join only the VSTS organization for which the user has paid for Basic access. But a user can join any VSTS organization where free users with Basic access are still available. The user can also join as a user with Stakeholder access for free.

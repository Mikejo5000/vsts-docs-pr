#### Q:	Why can't I sign in after I select "personal Microsoft account" or "work or school account"?

A: When your sign-in address is shared by your personal Microsoft account and by your work account or school account, but your selected identity doesn't have access, you can't sign in. Although both identities use the same sign-in address, they're separate: they have different profiles, security settings, and permissions.

Try to sign out completely from Azure DevOps Services by completing the following steps. Closing your browser might not sign you out completely from Azure DevOps Services. Sign in again to Azure DevOps Services and select your other identity:

1. Close all browsers, including browsers that aren't running Azure DevOps Services.

1. Open a private or incognito browsing session. 

1. Go to this URL: `http://aka.ms/vssignout`.

   You see a message that says, "Sign out in progress." After you sign out, you're redirected to the Visual Studio @visualstudio.microsoft.com webpage. 

   > [!TIP]
   > If the sign-out page takes more than a minute to sign you out, close the browser and continue.

1. Sign in to Azure DevOps Services again. Select your other identity.

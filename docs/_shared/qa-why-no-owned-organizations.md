#### Q:	Why don't I see the Azure DevOps Services organizations that I own after I sign in to my Visual Studio profile on visualstudio.com?

A:	The list of organizations that you own are associated with the identity that you use to sign in to Azure DevOps Services. 

If you were asked to choose between your personal Microsoft account or your work or school account when you signed in, you might have selected the wrong identity to sign in.

Try signing out completely from Azure DevOps Services. Then, sign in again, and select your other identity.

Closing your browser doesn't always completely sign you out from Azure DevOps Services. Here's how you can sign out completely:

1.	Close all browsers, including those that aren't running Azure DevOps Services.

1.	Open a private or incognito browsing session. 

1.	Go to this URL: http://aka.ms/vssignout.

	You'll see a message that says, "Sign out in progress." After you sign out, you're redirected to the Visual Studio @visualstudio.microsoft.com webpage. 

	> [!TIP]
	> If the sign-out page takes more than a minute to sign you out, close the browser and continue.

1.	Sign in to Azure DevOps Services again. Select your other identity.

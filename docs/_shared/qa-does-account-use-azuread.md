####Q:  How do I find out if my Team Services account controls access with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)?

A:	If you have at least Basic access, here's how:

0.	Go your Team Services account settings.

	<img alt="Go to account settings" src="./_img/account-settings-new-ui.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

0.	Under **Settings**, check if your account controls access with Azure AD.

	<img alt="Go to Settings, check for a connected directory" src="./_img/account-check-connected-azure-ad-new-ui.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

	If your account is connected to your organization's directory, 
	this means that only users from your organization's directory can join your account.

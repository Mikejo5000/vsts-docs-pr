####Q:	What happens if my Azure subscription is disabled?

A:	If you're the Team Services account owner or 
[Azure subscription Account Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator), 
check your subscription status in the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/), 
then try to [fix your subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing-subscription-become-disable). 
This will restore your account's paid settings. 
Or you can link your Team Services account to another Azure subscription by 
[unlinking your account from the disabled subscription](../setup-admin/team-services/set-up-billing-for-your-account-vs.md#change-azure-subscription). 
While your subscription is disabled, your account goes back to the free 
monthly limits until your subscription is fixed.

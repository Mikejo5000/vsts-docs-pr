####Q:  Why don't I see my Team Services account in the Azure portal?

A:  In both Azure portals, you must have 
[Azure Service Administrator or Co-administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator) 
permissions for the Azure subscription that's linked to your Team Services account. 
Also, in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you must have Team Services 
project collection administrator or account owner permissions.

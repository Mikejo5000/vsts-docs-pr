### Resolve images that don't display in Team Explorer 

If an in-line image fails to display in a work item form you view from Team Explorer, but does display in the web portal, your Visual Studio credentials to access Team Services or TFS have expired. 

You can resolve it with the following steps.  

1. In Visual Studio, click **View>Other Windows>Web Browser** (Or, use the shortcut **Cltr+Alt+R**).   
1. In the web browser, locate either your Visual Studio Team Services or TFS account.  
1. Login with your account.  
1. Refresh your work item in Team Explorer.

# Git at Scale - Limited Refs 

As we discussed in the [previous article](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/technical-scale-challenges), 
one of the major scale challenges for Git is dealing with the linear costs 
associated with having too many refs. Let's look a little more 
closely at the problem, and how we've solved it. And of course, 
since there's no such thing as a free lunch, we'll discuss the 
tradeoffs created by our solution. 

## The problem with refs 

### What is a ref? 
We often refer to this scale challenge as "too many branches" 
because it's easier to talk about, but in reality the challenge is 
"too many refs".

- For this specific issue, at least read Chapter 3 
  (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) 
  and section 9.3 (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals-Git-References) 

To summarize, Git history is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of 
commits, and a ref is a pointer to one of those commits. Branches 
and tags are special types of refs, but there are other kinds of 
refs as well. 

Refs are used to give convenient names to commits. They are also 
used in negotiations between the Git client and server to figure 
out how much contents to fetch and push. And in both cases, having 
lots and lots of refs can cause problems. 

### Linear perf costs 
When you run `git fetch` or `git pull`, the communication between 
the client and server looks something like this: 

- Git looks up the URL of the repo. By default, this is the URL 
configured for the origin remote. 
- Git sends a request to `<repo url>/info/refs`, and the server 
responds with the list of all known refs and the current commit id 
that each ref is pointing to (known as the tip commit of the ref)
- Git takes that list of refs and compares it with the list that it 
currently has locally. For each of these tip commits, Git checks to 
see if it already has that commit id, and if not, it will have to 
request it from the server. 
- The Git client then sends a request to `<repo url>/upload-pack` 
with information about which commit ids it has and which commit ids 
it wants. The client and server go back and forth a few times until 
they whittle the list of haves and wants down as much as they can. 
- Finally the server is able to compute which commits it needs to 
send to the client, and it creates a packfile with all of the 
contents for those commits and sends that to the client 
- If you want even more gory details, here's the full description of 
the protocol: https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/pack-protocol.txt 

The main point to take away from all of that is that the client and 
server have to do a lot of calculations to figure out what to fetch, 
and the number of calculations grows linearly with the number of 
refs. So the more refs there are, the longer it takes to even figure 
out what to send, before the client can start downloading the new 
contents. 

Before we did anything to fix this, devs in the VSTS repo had a 
pretty frustrating experience when they fetched. After typing 
`git fetch` or `git pull`, they would see the first acknowledgement 
from the server ("remote: Microsoft (R) Visual Studio (R) Team Services") fairly quickly, and 
then… nothing… sometimes lasting 5 minutes or 
longer, before a message like "remote: Found X objects to send". 
Only then would the download of new contents actually begin. 
The VSTS repo typically has as many as 20K refs in it, and the 
negotiations for that many refs take a while. 

### Usability costs 
There are also usability issues with having too many refs. Have you ever 
tried running `git branch -a` in a repo with 20K branches? Good luck 
finding the one you want. 

While refs are technically unstructured and can have whatever names 
you want to give them, we learned early on that you really need a 
good naming structure to help organize all those branches. In the 
VSTS repo, we like to use the pattern `users/<your alias>/<topic>` 
for topic branches, and similar patterns for release branches (`releases/*`), team 
branches (`teams/*`), and other "types" of branches that we commonly use. We'll 
talk more about those best practices in an upcoming article. 

We have also updated the tools that we build (like the VSTS web UI 
and Visual Studio's Team Explorer) to render branches as a 
hierarchy, but not all Git tools do this. See the example above 
about listing branches using the Git command line.

But even with those improvements, having 20K refs in the VSTS repo, or 
100K+ refs in the Windows repo presents a serious usability challenge for
a dev who needs to find one branch out of that huge list.

## Solution: Limited Refs 
Our solution to this problem is to allow a repo to be configured such that
it hides most of the refs from the 
client. We were able to do this with no changes at all to the Git 
client or to the protocol. Because the first step in the fetch 
protocol is that the client asks the server for the list of all refs,
we simply changed our server to filter its response to that 
info/refs request, and the rest of the fetch protocol plus all 
of your existing Git tools continue to work as normal. 

The difficult part of this is: what refs should we include in 
that info/refs response? We spent a bit of time refining this, 
because there are various tradeoffs to consider. The fewer branches you respond with, 
the less time each person spends fetching, but then they might not get
a branch that they care about. We also realized that there are cases where you really 
don't want the server to lie to you because you know you need every 
single branch.

To solve these issues, we've allowed for certain branches to be 
marked as "important" for all users of the repo, we've allowed users 
to mark additional branches that they know they care about, and 
we've also allowed you to bypass this feature entirely and specify that
you really want all branches.

### Important branches 
There are a set of branches in any repo that everyone will be very likely
to interact with, like the master and release branches. These refs can be configured to be included in 
the info/refs response for everyone, so that all users will see 
them. As an aside, it's very helpful to have a well-organized hierarchical 
naming pattern for your branches so that you can configure a small 
number of ref "folders" and not have to keep updating this list all 
the time.

For the VSTS repo, we know that every user needs the master branch. 
We also create a release branch at the end of each sprint, with the 
naming pattern of `releases/<sprint name>`, and we figure most 
people will need these branches as well. So we've configured Limited 
Refs to always return these refs to all of our users. As I write 
this, this configuration alone reduces the number of visible refs 
in the VSTS repo from about 20K down to 100. 

For the Windows repo, even all of the "important" branches would be 
too many, so we've taken a more extreme position there and just 
included the master branch by default. More on this in the tradeoffs 
section below. 

### My branches 
Any branch that you personally created is one that you almost 
certainly care about. So in addition to returning all of the branches 
that are configured as important, we also return to you all branches 
that you have personally created. 

### Favorite branches 
And we know that no matter how much flexibility we provide in the 
configuration of important branches, we can never fine tune it 
perfectly for each individual person. Therefore in the VSTS web 
UI (or via REST APIs) you can also mark any branch or branch 
"folder" as a favorite, and all of your favorite branches are also
included in the responses to your info/refs requests. 

### The result 
The net effect of all this is that the branches that you'll see in 
your local clone of a repo are: 

- All of the repo's important branches 
- All branches that you created 
- All branches that you favorited 

As a result of that, a typical user in the VSTS repo now sees around 
100 branches at clone time instead of close to 20K, and the negotiations at the 
beginning of fetch now take a couple of seconds instead of minutes. 
And a typical user in the Windows repo sees a couple dozen branches 
instead of 100K or more.

### Bypassing Limited Refs 
When you turn on Limited Refs for a repo and make it the default 
behavior, all of the filtering rules described above will apply to 
anyone who uses the normal repo URL. For a typical repo, this URL 
looks like `https://<account>.visualstudio.com/Project/_git/Repo`. 
However, sometimes you just need access to all the refs, and for 
those situations, we've added an alternative form of the repo URL: 
`https://<account>.visualstudio.com/Project/_git/_full/Repo`. By 
adding that _full part to the URL, you can bypass Limited Refs and 
get an unfiltered list of refs when you clone or fetch. This is 
often useful for build servers and other automated tools that know 
how to manage their own list of refs.

## Tradeoffs 

### Finding other people's branches 
The biggest issue with Limited Refs is that now users can't see all 
of the branches in the repo. This is of course the whole point - the 
fewer branches you have, the leaner your repo is. But there are 
plenty of times when you need to work with a branch that might not 
be included in the limited set that you're working with locally. 
The most common example is that someone posted a pull request for 
their topic branch, and you want to checkout that branch and run 
some local tests on it.

The simplest answer to this is that you can just go mark that branch 
as a favorite and then fetch again. But this isn't a great answer on its 
own, because it would require you to have to remember a bunch of 
steps (go to the web, find the branch, favorite it, go to your repo, 
fetch) every time you want to work with someone else's branch. 

In the VSTS repo, what we've done is adopt a naming pattern that 
allows people to very easily favorite all of their nearby teammates' 
topic branches. Across the broader team, there are 400+ people, but any 
given feature team has around 10 or so people in it. So the pattern 
we've adopted is that each team creates all of their topic branches 
using the naming pattern `teams/<team name>/<user's alias>/<topic>`. 
Each person on a team can then just go favorite the 
`teams/<team name>` "branch folder" in the VSTS web UI, and from 
then on they have access to all branches created by their nearby 
teammates. 

The Windows team has taken a different approach. They've created a command
line tool that will call the VSTS REST APIs to favorite a branch. 
If a user wants to favorite a branch, they can just call that tool 
and pass in the name of the branch, and then run `git fetch` again.

### Branch organization 
This is perhaps the biggest issue with Limited Refs - it requires a 
fair bit of upfront work to get your branches under control using 
well-defined naming patterns. Otherwise, it becomes very difficult 
to manage the set of important branches, difficult to favorite 
"folders" of branches that you care about, etc. 

In an upcoming article, we'll get into more detail about branch naming best practices.

## Why not forks? 
Astute readers often notice that Limited Refs looks an awful lot 
like forks, so why not just use forks? 
 
This is a bigger topic that we may expand on in a future article, 
but the short answer is that forks were designed to solve a trust 
boundary problem. In the open source world, you often accept changes 
from people with whom you have no trust relationship. In that model, 
it's very important to confine the changes that other people can 
make and to selectively decide which parts of their changes you will 
accept into your own repo. 

Within a team in a typical enterprise environment, there is no trust 
issue, because you all work for the same company. Forks can still be 
useful in this environment, and many teams prefer to work using 
forks. However, forks do add some additional hurdles, and it's often 
more efficient to just have everyone work in a single repo. For 
example, consider the scenario we talked about earlier where someone 
else pushed a branch and you just want to check it out locally and 
run some tests on it. With forks, you have to manage multiple 
remotes, carefully manage where you're pulling from and pushing to, 
etc.

So forks are great, and Limited Refs are great, and you need to 
decide which one is right for your team. In the end, forks solve a 
trust boundary problem, and Limited Refs solves a scale problem.

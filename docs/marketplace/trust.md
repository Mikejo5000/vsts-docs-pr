# Protective scans & Marketplace Certified

## Protective Scans
As a Marketplace user, you can expect to avoid malicious software (malware) when you acquire an extension from Visual Studio Marketplace. To ensure this, we run a comprehensive virus scan on each extension package we receive. This is performed for each new extension and for each extension update. Until the scan is all clear, we do **not** publish the extension in Marketplace for public usage.
> Stated virus scan is a publish time check and is not run during an extension's execution.

We also perform a content scan for each extension in Marketplace. This is performed for each new extension and for each extension update. We avoid publication of inapproprate or offensive content in extensions through the content scan.

Share with us which additional protective measures will help you through our [UserVoice](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/331878-visual-studio-marketplace).

## Marketplace Certified
The Marketplace Certified program is designed to help you acquire extensions with confidence. Publishers with the Marketplace Certified badge imply that the publisher has met the benchmarks of being a good publisher in Marketplace. Marketplace assigns the badge to a publisher after carefully reviewing the publisher across various parameters:
* Privacy policy
* Licensing policy
* Support policy
* Q&A responsiveness
* Ratings & Review for their extensions
* Install count for their extensions
* Marketplace presence

You can expect timely support and good customer experience when acquiring an extension from a certified publisher. Check out the [offerings from our certified publishers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSTS&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Downloads).

> Publisher certification is only applicable for publishers with one or more public VSTS/TFS extensions or integrations.

If you acquired an extension from a certified publisher and aren't satisfied with your experience, please [reach out to the Marketplace team](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/marketplace/marketplace-billing-qa).

We recommend installing and evaluating an extension on an isolated account first for testing purposes. For any questions, reach out to the publisher via the Q&A section of the extension's Marketplace listing. Once you are satisfied with your testing, you can install the extension on other accounts. Any update to an extension could possibly break that trust, however we expect that our publishers and ecosystem will help us keep the system clean. If a genuine concern is reported or discovered, the Marketplace team will disable the extension in question and notify its customers appropriately.

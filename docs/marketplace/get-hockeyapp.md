#	Get HockeyApp: Bring DevOps to mobile app development

Distribute mobile apps for testing, collect user metrics and feedback, 
and respond to crashes more easily by adding 
[HockeyApp](https://www.visualstudio.com/hockey-app-vs) 
to your Agile, continuous integration, and continuous delivery workflows.

Build apps for Android, iOS, Mac OS X, and the Windows platform using
Cordova, Unity, Xamarin, or native languages. Upload your apps to HockeyApp, 
so you can invite users to test them. Collect their feedback, metrics, 
and live crash reports at any development stage, even after releasing 
your apps through a store. Your users will always have the latest 
versions and get updates automatically. Your developers will always get 
the latest user feedback and crash reports.

HockeyApp works with tools that support team-based development 
and collaboration, work item and project management, continuous 
integration and delivery, such as Visual Studio Team Services, 
Team Foundation Server, GitHub, Bamboo, Jira, and more. 

Learn more about:

* HockeyApp at the 
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.hockeyapp) 
or at the [HockeyApp.net website](http://hockeyapp.net/features/)

* Tools and apps that integrate with HockeyApp at the 
[HockeyApp Knowledge Base](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb)

##	How do I get HockeyApp?

You'll need a HockeyApp plan for the number of apps and owners in your HockeyApp account. 
Owners can create and delete apps in your account.  Learn more about [HockeyApp plans](http://hockeyapp.net/pricing/).

For example, you can start for free with just 1 account owner and up to 10 apps when you sign 
up for the HockeyApp Free Plan.  If you have more than 1 account owner, you'll need a HockeyApp Business Plan, 
no matter how many apps you have. [Still not sure which plan to choose?](#choose-plan)

You can get the 
[HockeyApp Free plan](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.hockeyapp-free) 
or buy [monthly HockeyApp Business plans](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) 
directly from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

or a work or school account, like @fabrikam.com

*	A [Microsoft Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/) 
to use for billing purchases from the Visual Studio Marketplace

	[set up for billing](../setup-admin/team-services/set-up-billing-for-your-account-vs.md).

## Q & A

<a name="choose-plan"></a>

####Q:	How do I choose a HockeyApp plan?
 
A: Start with a plan that supports the number of apps 
that you want to host and the number of account owners 
that can create and delete apps in your HockeyApp account.
You can always change plans later. You have unlimited
storage and can upload as many versions of your app as you need.

**Note**: The same app for each platform counts as a separate app. 
For example, if you want to ship an app for both iOS and Android, 
this app counts as 2 apps, whether you build it with Cordova 
and a single code base, or build for each platform natively.

For example, if you have:

| HockeyApp account owners | Number of apps | Choose this HockeyApp plan |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Exactly 1                | Up to 10       | [Free plan](#free-plan) |
| More than 1              | Any            | [Business plan](http://hockeyapp.net/pricing/#business) |

[HockeyApp Knowledge Base](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/general-account-management-2/how-to-sign-up-for-a-paid-plan).

####Q:	Why buy HockeyApp Business plans from Visual Studio Marketplace?

A: You can buy HockeyApp Business plans on a monthly basis

like a billing account.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, just

before or during your first Marketplace purchase. You can also 
use your Azure subscription to buy other Azure services, 
like Cloud Services, compute instances, Visual Studio Team Services, 
and more. You get everything all in one convenient monthly bill

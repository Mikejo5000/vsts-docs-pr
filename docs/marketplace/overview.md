or Visual Studio Code. You can find extensions from within these product or from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/). 

You can install them with a few clicks. You must have administrative permissions to upload or install extensions.

## Billing and subscriptions
<a name="azure-billing-info"></a>

### Azure Billing
When you buy from the Visual Studio Marketplace, you select an Azure subscription to use for billing. 
If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can [sign up](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) 
either before or during your first purchase. You can set up payment with a credit card, 
or by invoice in some cases. Charges for your purchases will show up on your monthly Azure bill.

>[!NOTE]  
>You must keep your Azure subscription in good standing to use your Visual Studio Marketplace purchases. 

If your Azure subscription is canceled or becomes disabled, for example, because the credit card used for payment expires, 
then any purchases with this Azure subscription will be deactivated on the 1st day of the next month. 
To continue using your Visual Studio Marketplace purchases, please keep your Azure subscription active and updated.

For example, if you bought a Visual Studio Professional subscription, and you used an Azure subscription that becomes disabled, 
your Visual Studio Professional IDE will stop working on the 1st of the following month. This also applies to annual 
Visual Studio subscriptions that are paid in full for the year. 

>[!NOTE] 
>You can't use the [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) to pay for Visual Studio Marketplace purchases, 
>which applies to Visual Studio Team Services, HockeyApp user plans, and so on.

### Billing frequency

For subscriptions, the billing frequency depends on the subscription that you purchased:

* Monthly subscriptions are prorated during the 1st month. After that, they're billed on the 1st day of the calendar month.

* Annual subscriptions are always purchased in whole increments and are never prorated. Charges for subsequent years 
will be billed on the 1st day of the calendar month after the anniversary date of your subscription purchase.

>[!NOTE]  
> To find answers to commonly asked questions such as how to remove the spending limit in Azure or other questions around Visual Studio Subscriptions and Azure Billing, see [Marketplace and Billing Q&A](./marketplace-billing-qa.md). 

For the billing frequency of extensions, see [Get extensions for Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/marketplace/get-vsts-extensions#bill-period).

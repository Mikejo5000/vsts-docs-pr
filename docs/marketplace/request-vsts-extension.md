# Request permission for an extension for Visual Studio Team Services

**Team Services**


You need Team Services [project collection administrators or account owners](faq-extensions.md#find-owner) permissions to install extensions.

If you don't have permissions, you can request extensions instead:

0.  Sign in to [Visual Studio Marketplace > Visual Studio Team Services](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vsts).
	
	<img alt="Visual Studio Marketplace" src="_img/get-vsts-extensions/marketplace.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

0. Find and select the extension that you want to request.

0. Try to install the extension.

	<img alt="Extension details" src="./_img/get-vsts-extensions/hockey-app-extension.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

0. Select the Team Services account where you want to install the extension. 
If you don't have permissions to install the extension, 
you can request it now.

	<img alt="Request extension" src="./_img/get-vsts-extensions/request-install.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

	You can review your requests after the Visual Studio Marketplace sends the request to the account owner.	

	<img alt="Go to requests" src="./_img/get-vsts-extensions/view-request.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

	Your requests appear on your Team Services account's extensions page.

	<img alt="View requested extensions" src="./_img/get-vsts-extensions/my-request.png" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC" />

	Your Team Services account owner or project collection administrator 
	can review your request after they get it.

# Find or change your VSTS organization location (region)

**VSTS**

When you [create an organization](create-organization-msa-or-work-student.md), you can choose the region where VSTS hosts your
organization.  You may choose your organization's region due to locality and network latency or because you have sovereignty
requirements for data centers.  Your organization's default location is based on the closest 
[Microsoft Azure region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions) 
where VSTS is available.

For information on region availability, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/).

To find the region where your organization is located:

1. Sign in to your Team Services organization: ```https://{yourorganization}.visualstudio.com```

2. On your organization toolbar, choose the gear icon, and choose **Settings**: ```https://{yourorganization}.visualstudio.com/_admin/_home/settings```

3. Look under **Region**.

To change your organization region, you need to call [VSTS Support](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/support), and 
they will coordinate changing the region with the organization owner.

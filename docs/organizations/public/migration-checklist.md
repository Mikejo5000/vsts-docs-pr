# Migration checklist

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/version-public-projects.md)] 

Most existing team projects contain a large amount of historical data.
Old work items, early commits, and previous build definitions might have content you aren't comfortable sharing publicly.
This checklist contains a list of things to think about before making a project public.
Also, it has ideas for migrating the latest state to a new project so that you can expose only current and future content.

## Checklist by area

### Entire account

[!INCLUDE [warning](_shared/warning-cross-link.md)]

### Agile

* Confirm that your work items, even closed ones, don't contain sensitive details: undisclosed security flaws, credentials, and customer data.
* Be aware that all discussions and descriptions are available. Check that none contain embarrassing or problematic speech.
* Confirm that none of your area paths have special, locked-down security settings. Denied permissions are not enforced in a public project, so these restricted area paths will become public.

>[!TIP]
> If you aren't comfortable exposing the whole work item database, you have migration options.
> See the [instructions for moving work items](#work-item-migration).

### Code

* Confirm that you have no sensitive details in your repositories' history: unpatched security bugs, credentials, and code you don't have the right to distribute.
* Be aware that all file contents and commit messages are available. Check that none contain embarrassing or problematic speech.

>[!TIP]
> If you aren't comfortable exposing an entire repository, you can migrate the tip to another project.
> See the [instructions for a tip migration](#git-tip-only-migration).

### CI/CD

* Confirm that none of your definitions exposes sensitive data: credentials/secrets, obscure URLs, and private environment names.
* Confirm that non-members don't require access to your private packaging feeds. Builds can still access feeds, but non-members cannot.

If you need to migrate build definitions to a new project (perhaps because you're moving code or work items), you can import & export using [YAML](../../pipelines/actions/build-yaml.md).

### Testing

* Understand that your manual testing and Cloud Load Testing features will not be available to non-members.

### Analytics & dashboards

* Consider building a dashboard intended for the public. Some [widgets are unavailable](feature-differences.md#analytics--dashboards) to non-members, so don't rely on these.

### Extensions

Are any extensions vital to your project's experience?
For instance, do you have a control on your work item form which renders data in a particular way?
Are there custom hubs which expose important details?

* Confirm that each extension's author has made it available for non-members by testing it.
* If not, ask the extension author to add support for non-members.
 
## Partial migration tips

### Work item migration

If one or a handful of work items are sensitive, you can [move them](../../work/backlogs/remove-delete-work-items.md#move) out into a separate, private project.
Cross-project linkages will continue to work for members.
Non-members will not have access to the content since it resides in a private project.

If you have a large number of sensitive work items, consider keeping your current project private and creating a new public project.
You can migrate a few work items by hand into the new project.
Migrating a large number of work items can be accomplished using the open source [WiMigrator](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-work-item-migrator) maintained by Microsoft.

### Git tip-only migration
If a repository cannot be shared due to problematic history, consider doing a tip-only migration to a new repository in a different project.
The project containing the problematic repository should remain private.
The new repository should be created in a project you don't mind making public.

>[!WARNING]
>The new repository will have no connection to the old one.
>You won't easily be able to migrate changes between them in the future.
>Also, your pull request history will not be migrated.

- Clone the existing repository: `git clone <clone_URL>`
- Make sure you're in the root of the repository: `cd <reponame>`
- Ensure you're on the tip of the branch you want to start from, usually master: `git checkout master`
- Delete the Git data: `rmdir /s .git` on Windows, `rm -rf .git` on macOS or Linux
- Initialize a new Git repository: `git init`
- Create a new, empty repository in your public project.
- Add the new repository as your origin remote: `git remote add origin <new_clone_URL>`
- Push up your new repository: `git push --set-upstream origin master`

# Buy Azure DevOps Services resources for your customers

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../../_shared/version-vsts-only.md)]

Partners in the cloud service provider (CSP) program can purchase [Azure DevOps Services resources](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/pricing) for
their customers, including Azure DevOps Services users (who get Basic features), Test Manager, Package Management, Private Pipelines, and
Hosted Pipelines.

## Prerequisites

To set up billing for a customer who's already created an Azure DevOps Services organization by using a Microsoft account identity
(in other words, not an identity in their Azure Active Directory), the customer needs to do the following steps first:

1. Your customer must [change their Azure DevOps Services organization to be backed by their Azure Active Directory](../../accounts/access-with-azure-ad.md).
1. Your customer must [unlink the existing Azure subscription that's used for billing on their Azure DevOps Services organization](../change-azure-subscription.md), if they had previously set up billing.

Make sure your identity hasn't been added into the customer's Azure Active Directory. If it has, you need to have the identity removed before you can go through the purchasing steps for your customer.

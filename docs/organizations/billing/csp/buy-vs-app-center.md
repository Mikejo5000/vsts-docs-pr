# Buy Visual Studio App Center resources

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-all-versions](../../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Partners in the cloud service provider (CSP) program can enable their customers to purchase [Visual Studio App Center resources](http://visualstudio.microsoft.com/app-center/) by using a CSP-based Azure subscription. Resources include build pipelines, test device concurrencies, and advanced push notifications.

To enable the customer to purchase App Center resources by using a CSP-based Azure subscription, confirm the following points:

* The customer has **Org Admin** rights in App Center, which grants them access to the **Billing** tab.

* The customer has **Owner** role permissions to the CSP-based Azure subscription in order to make purchases. Learn more about [how to add users with co-owner permissions](/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#add-or-change-co-administrator).

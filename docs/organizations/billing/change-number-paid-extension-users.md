# Change the number of paid users for an Azure DevOps Services extension

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-all-versions](../../_shared/version-vsts-tfs-all-versions.md)]

To scale with your team's needs, you can increase or decrease the number of paid users for a feature or extension.  

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites 

You need Azure DevOps Services [project collection administrator or organization owner permissions](../accounts/faq-add-delete-users.md#find-owner).

1. Sign in to your Azure DevOps Services organization, ```https://dev.azure.com/{yourorganization}```.

2. Go to **Extensions**. Then select the extension you want to update.

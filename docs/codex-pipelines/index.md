# What is Codex Pipelines?

Codex Pipelines is one of several cloud service applications provided in the Azure Codex suite of applications.


The **Build & Release** hub provides an integrated set of features to support building and deploying your applications. 


<img src="../user-guide/_img/services/build-release-hub.png" alt="Build-Release hub, Build definitions page" style="border: 2px solid #C3C3C3;" />

Use this hub to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery.

- **Build automation**: Define the steps to take during build and the triggers that will initiate a build. 
- **Release management**: Supports a rapid release cadence and management of simultaneous releases. You can configure release definitions that represent your environments from development to production. Run automations to deploy your app to each environment. Add approvers to sign off that the app has been successfully deployed in an environment. Create your release manually or automatically from a build. Then track your releases as they are deployed to various environments.


To learn more, see [Continuous integration on any platform](../build-release/overview.md).

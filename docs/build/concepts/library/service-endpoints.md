# Service endpoints for Build and Release

**TFS 2015 | TFS 2017 | Team Services**

You will typically need to connect to external and remote services to execute tasks
for a build or deployment. For example, you may need to connect to your Microsoft Azure
subscription, to a different build server or file server, to an online continuous
integration environment, or to services you install on remote computers.

Watch this video on Channel 9 to learn about service endpoints.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="//channel9.msdn.com/Series/DevOps-Release-Management/Service-Endpoints-with-Visual-Studio-Team-Services/player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe><p />

You can define endpoints in Team Services or Team Foundation Server that are available for use in all
your tasks. For example, you can create an endpoint for your Azure subscription
and use this endpoint name in an Azure Web Site Deployment task in a release definition.

You define and manage service endpoints from the Admin settings of your team project.
* Team Services: `https://{account}.visualstudio.com/{teamproject}/_admin/_services`
* TFS: `https://{tfsserver}/{collection}/{teamproject}/_admin/_services`

Service endpoints are created at project scope. An endpoint created in one project is not visible in another team project.

## Common endpoint types

Team Services and TFS support a variety of endpoint types by default. Some of these are described below:

* [Azure Classic service endpoint](#sep-azure-classic)
* [Azure Resource Manager service endpoint](#sep-azure-rm)
* [Azure Service Fabric service endpoint](#sep-servfabric)
* [External Git service endpoint](#sep-extgit)
* [Generic service endpoint](#sep-generic)
* [GitHub service endpoint](#sep-github)
* [Jenkins service endpoint](#sep-jenkins)
* [SSH service endpoint](#sep-ssh)
* [Subversion service endpoint](#sep-subversion)

After you enter the parameters when creating a service endpoint, validate the
connection. The validation link uses a REST call to the external service with
the information you entered, and indicates if the call succeeded.

<h3 id="sep-azure-classic">Azure Classic service endpoint</h3>

Defines and secures a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription
using Azure credentials or an Azure management certificate.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| \[authentication type\] | Required. Select **Credentials** or **Certificate based**. |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this endpoint in task properties. This is not the name of your Azure account or subscription. |
| Environment | Required. Select **Azure Cloud** or one of the pre-defined [Azure Government Clouds](government-cloud.md) where your subscription is defined. |
| Subscription ID | Required. The GUID-like identifier for your Azure subscription (not the subscription name). You can copy this from the Azure portal. |
| Subscription Name | Required. The name of your Microsoft Azure subscription (account). |
| User name | Required for Credentials authentication. User name of a work or school account (for example @fabrikam.com). Microsoft accounts (for example @live or @hotmail) are not supported. |
| Password | Required for Credentials authentication. Password for the user specified above. |
| Management Certificate | Required for Certificate based authentication. Copy the value of the management certificate key from your [publish settings XML file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=312990) or the Azure portal. |

>If your subscription is defined in an [Azure Government Cloud](government-cloud.md), ensure your application meets the relevant compliance requirements before you configure a service endpoint.

<h3 id="sep-azure-rm">Azure Resource Manager service endpoint</h3>

Defines and secures a connection to a Microsoft Azure subscription
using Service Principal Authentication (SPA). The dialog offers two modes:

**Automated subscription detection**. 

You cannot use this version of the dialog to connect to an [Azure Government Cloud](government-cloud.md).

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this endpoint in task properties. This is not the name of your Azure account or subscription. |
| Subscription | Select an existing Azure subscription. [More information](#sep-azure-rm-conditions). |
<p />

**Manual subscription definition**

You must use this version of the dialog when connecting to an [Azure Government Cloud](government-cloud.md).

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Connection Name | Required. The name you will use to refer to this endpoint in task properties. This is not the name of your Azure account or subscription. |
| Environment | Required. Select **Azure Cloud** or one of the pre-defined [Azure Government Clouds](government-cloud.md) where your subscription is defined. |
| Subscription ID | Required only if you want to use an existing service principal. The GUID-like identifier for your Azure subscription (not the subscription name). [More information](#sep-azure-rm-existingsp). |
| Subscription Name | Required only if you want to use an existing service principal. The name of your Microsoft Azure subscription (account). [More information](#sep-azure-rm-existingsp). |
| Service Principal ID | Required only if you want to use an existing service principal. The Azure Active Directory client ID of the account. [More information](#sep-azure-rm-existingsp). |
| Service Principal Key | Required only if you want to use an existing service principal. The Azure Active Directory client key of the account. [More information](#sep-azure-rm-existingsp). |
| Tenant ID | Required only if you want to use an existing service principal. The ID of the client tenant in Azure Active Directory. [More information](#sep-azure-rm-existingsp). |
<p />

>If your subscription is defined in an [Azure Government Cloud](government-cloud.md), ensure your application meets the relevant compliance requirements before you configure a service endpoint.

<a name="sep-azure-rm-conditions"></a>
When you start to create the endpoint, the code interrogates Azure
for subscriptions that are valid for the credentials you are currently
signed into Team Services or TFS with. This applies to both Microsoft
accounts and School or Work accounts. It displays a list of these for
you to select the one you want to use.

If no subscriptions are shown, or subscriptions other than the one you
want to use, you must sign out of Team Services or TFS and sign in again
using the appropriate account credentials. See also
[Troubleshoot Azure Resource Manager service endpoints](../../actions/azure-rm-endpoint.md).

<a name="sep-azure-rm-existingsp"></a>
Selecting an existing subscription automatically creates a new Azure
service principal that is assigned the **Contributor** role and so has
access to all resources within the subscription.
You can edit this service principal in the Azure portal,
**Subscriptions | Users | Roles** section. For more details, see
[Team Services: Access with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/setup-admin/team-services/manage-organization-access-for-your-account-vs).

If you want to use an existing service principal instead of creating
a new one:

1. Download and run [this PowerShell script](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-rm-documentation/blob/master/Azure/SPNCreation.ps1) in an Azure PowerShell window.
   When prompted, enter your subscription name, password, role (optional), and the type of cloud such as Azure Cloud (the default) or an Azure Government Cloud.
1. Switch from the simplified version of the dialog to the full version using the link in the dialog.

   ![Opening the full version of the service endpoint dialog](_img/rm-endpoint-link.png)

1. Enter a user-friendly name to use when referring to this service endpoint connection.
1. Select the Environment name (such as Azure Cloud or an Azure Government Cloud).
1. Copy these fields from the output of the PowerShell script into the Azure subscription dialog textboxes:
   - Subscription ID
   - Subscription Name
   - Service Principal ID
   - Service Principal Key
   - Tenant ID<p/>

## Extensions for other endpoints

Other service endpoint types and tasks can be installed in Team Services
and Team Foundation Server as extensions. Some examples of service endpoints currently
available through extensions are:

* [TFS artifacts for Release Management](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscs-rm.vss-services-externaltfs).
  Deploy on-premises TFS builds with Team Services
  Release Management through a TFS service endpoint
  connection and the **Team Build (external)** artifact,
  even when the TFS machine is not reachable directly
  from Team Services. For more information, see
  [External TFS](../definitions/release/artifacts.md#onpremtfssource) and
  [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/04/05/deploy-artifacts-from-onprem-tfs-server-with-release-management-service/).

* [TeamCity artifacts for Release Management](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.vss-services-teamcity).
  This extension provides integration with TeamCity through a TeamCity service endpoint,
  enabling artifacts produced in TeamCity to be deployed
  by using Release Management. See
  [TeamCity](../definitions/release/artifacts.md#teamcitysource)
  for more details.

* [SCVMM Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-vscs-rm.scvmmapp).
  Connect to a System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) server to easily
  provision virtual machines and perform actions on
  them such as managing checkpoints, starting and
  stopping VMs, and running PowerShell scripts.

* [VMware Resource Deployment](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=ms-vscs-rm.vmwareapp).
  Connect to a VMware vCenter Server from Visual Studio Team
  Services or Team Foundation Server to provision,
  start, stop, or snapshot VMware virtual machines.

For information about creating your own custom extensions, see
[Overview of extensions for Visual Studio Team Services](../../../../integrate/extensions/overview.md).

<h2 id="security">Endpoint security</h2>

You can control who can define new service endpoints in a library, and who can use an existing service endpoint. **Roles** are defined for  service endpoints, and **membership** in these roles governs the operations you can perform on those endpoints.

| Role on a library service endpoint | Purpose |
|------------------------------------|---------|
| User | Members of this role can use the endpoint when authoring build or release definitions. |
| Administrator | In addition to using the endpoint, members of this role can manage membership of all other roles for the service endpoint. The user that created the service endpoint is automatically added to the Administrator role for that service endpoint.

A special group called **Endpoint administrators** is added to every team project. Members of this group can create new endpoints. By default, project administrators are added as members of this group. This group is also added as an administrator to every endpoint created.

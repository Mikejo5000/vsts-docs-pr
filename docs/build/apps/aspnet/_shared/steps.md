To create your CI/CD pipeline, you'll do the following:

- [Get set up](#get-set-up) with a repository for the solution in Team Services along with an Azure web app to which you can deploy the solution.
- [Define and test your CI build](#ci) to automatically build the solution when changes are committed to the repository.
- [Define and test your CD release](#cd) to automatically deploy a successful build to Azure.
- [Check in a change and see it automatically go live](#check-in) demonstrates the power of a release pipeline in action.

#	Visual Studio cloud subscription purchasing FAQ

Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise are each available as monthly and annual cloud subscriptions. When you choose the annual option, 
you also get subscriber benefits including a monthly Azure credit to use for trying out Azure services risk-free for development and testing, 
Microsoft software to install and use for dev/test, training from Pluralsight, and much more.

To compare subscription options along with a detailed view of the subscriber benefits that are included, review 
the [Visual Studio pricing page](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing).

## Understanding whether cloud subscriptions are a fit for you

###Q:	Who should consider buying monthly cloud subscriptions?

If you need Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise, and aren't sure how long you'll need it, then the monthly cloud subscription can be a great way to buy. 
You're under no long-term obligation and can cancel anytime. If your development environment runs on the cloud or on your own PC and you don't need 
a license to use Windows, SQL Server, or other Microsoft software for dev/test (which is included only with annual cloud subscriptions and standard subscriptions), 
then monthly is still an option.

And if you're using VSTS or TFS already, having a Visual Studio monthly cloud subscription can be a great upgrade: VSTS and TFS use is included for you. This 
means that you can avoid needing a TFS CAL when using TFS, and that you can be added to any VSTS account for free (you don't count against the 5 free users per 
VSTS account, and there's no charge to add you as a member).

###Q:	What are the differences between annual cloud subscriptions and standard subscriptions?

A:	The subscriber benefits are the same, so you'll get the same subscriber benefits when purchasing either the standard subscription or the annual cloud subscription. 
The main differences have to do with the length of your subscription term before it expires, what purchasing channel you use to buy the subscription, whether you can continue 
using software after your subscription expires (perpetual use rights), and how you unlock Visual Studio (product key or sign in, or sign in only). See the 
"Cloud vs. Standard subscriptions" tab on the [Visual Studio pricing page](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/pricing).

###Q:	Do I get new versions of Visual Studio IDEs if I buy a Visual Studio cloud subscription?

A:	Yes, and this is true for any Visual Studio subscription, standard or cloud, annual or monthly. You're entitled to any new version that releases while your subscription 
is active, plus any versions that were previously released. As an active subscriber, you can install and run any version of Visual Studio that's included, 
on as many machines as you need.

As a Visual Studio cloud subscriber, you will need to sign in if you're using any version of Visual Studio that is 2013 or later. Just download the trial version from 
[Subscriber Downloads](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads/featured) and sign in with the identity that you used to activate your Visual Studio subscription. 
Signing in unlocks the trial, and you can start coding!

## Cloud subscription purchasing channels

###Q:	Where are Visual Studio cloud subscriptions offered?

A:	Visual Studio subscriptions are sold worldwide, in all markets where Microsoft Azure is 
[commercially available](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/faq/). 

###Q:	Why don't I see Visual Studio cloud subscriptions in the Azure portal?

A:	You can only buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions). 
As you step through the buying process, you will choose the Azure subscription where your charges will be billed. 

###Q:	Can I buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions from my software reseller?

A:	No, you don't buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions through software resellers like you would traditionally buy Microsoft software licenses. Therefore you will 
**never** submit a purchase order to buy a Visual Studio cloud subscription. If a mistake is made and you do submit a PO, it will be necessary for your reseller to 
credit this back because the PO will not result in you getting the Visual Studio cloud subscription.

Even though we do not support the sale of Visual Studio cloud subscriptions in the same way as traditional Microsoft software licenses, we do offer 
Visual Studio cloud subscriptions through Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs), through Enterprise Agreement resellers, and through the Microsoft Open 
volume licensing program. Here is how it works for each:
* Cloud Solution Providers buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions via the Visual Studio Marketplace, on behalf of their customers, and then assigns Visual Studio to the 
developers for that customer, and bills the customer for this and other services. [How to buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions for CSPs](/csp/buy-manage-vs-subs)
* Enterprise Agreement resellers help their customers set up Azure subscriptions under their EA, and then the customer buys Visual Studio cloud subscriptions via 
the Visual Studio Marketplace using this EA-based Azure subscription for billing. All Visual Studio cloud subscription charges are billed as overages for EA customers, 
so any prepaid balance (from an Azure Monetary Commitment) is left untouched, and must be used for other Azure services (virtual machines, VSTS, SQL DB, etc.).
* Open resellers sell a fixed amount of Azure to their customers, and then the customer creates an Azure subscription where this prepaid balance is applied, and then can 
buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions via the Visual Studio Marketplace using this Azure subscription. In the case of Open, the prepaid balance does apply for the 
Visual Studio cloud subscription charges, and overages are only incurred when the prepaid balance has been depleted.

>[!NOTE]
> In **all** cases, Visual Studio cloud subscriptions are **always** purchased via the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com). 
> 
> You will never submit a PO for a Visual Studio cloud subscription.

###Q:	Can I buy Visual Studio cloud subscriptions using the monthly Azure credit I get as a Visual Studio subscriber?

A: Your monthly Azure credit does not apply to Visual Studio cloud subscriptions, VSTS, Xamarin University, Application Insights, or the Visual Studio App Center. If you choose to 
use the Azure subscription that you set up using this subscriber benefit, you'll need to remove your spending limit so that the charges can be processed using the credit 
card you put on file.

## Cloud subscription pricing and discounts 

###Q:	What kind of volume discounts are available for Visual Studio cloud subscriptions?

A:	You get a 5% discount on the 6th and all subsequent subscriptions within each type of subscription: 

*	[Visual Studio Professional - monthly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-professional-monthly)
*	[Visual Studio Professional - annual](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-professional-annual)
*	[Visual Studio Enterprise - monthly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-enterprise-monthly)
*	[Visual Studio Enterprise - annual](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.vs-enterprise-annual)

So for example, if you buy 6 Visual Studio Professional 
monthly subscriptions and 5 Visual Studio Enterprise 
monthly subscriptions, you'll pay the regular price on 
5 Professional, get a 5% discount on the 6th Professional, 
and pay regular price on all 5 Enterprise subscriptions. 

Also, the discount only applies to charges in a given monthly 
billing period. So if you buy 5 Visual Studio Professional annual 
subscriptions in one month, and then you buy 5 more the next month, 
you'll pay the regular price on all 10 subscriptions.

This discounting structure applies to Visual Studio cloud subscriptions purchased using any type of Azure subscription for billing--Pay-As-You-Go, Enterprise Agreement, 
CSP, etc.

###Q:	Are there renewal discounts?

A:	No, prices for Visual Studio cloud subscriptions are the same each month (for monthly cloud subscriptions), and each year (for annual cloud subscriptions).

###Q:	Are there supplemental Enterprise Agreement discounts available for Visual Studio cloud subscriptions?

A:	No, the only discounts available are based on volume of purchases. See above.

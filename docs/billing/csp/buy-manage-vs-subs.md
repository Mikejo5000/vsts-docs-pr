> NOTE:
> Visual Studio subscribers qualify for dev/test pricing. Your customers can sign themselves up for their 
> individual Azure monthly credit or PAYG team dev/test, but as a CSP, you can't access the dev/test discounts 
> for your customers. Point customers to [Azure dev/test pricing](http://aka.ms/azuredevtestpricing) to learn about 
> their options.

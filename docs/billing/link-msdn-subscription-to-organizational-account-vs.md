**VSTS**

To set up the linking between your Microsoft account to your work or school account ([learn more](link-msdn-subscription-concept.md)), sign in to the Visual Studio subscriptions portal (```https://my.visualstudio.com```) with your Microsoft account, and follow the steps below:


<a name="my-visualstudio-com"></a>

0.	Sign in with your Microsoft account to the 
[Visual Studio subscriptions portal (https://my.visualstudio.com)](https://my.visualstudio.com).

	> If you're asked to choose "personal account" 
	> or "work or school account", choose "personal account" (your Microsoft account). 
	>
	> Sometimes you need to choose because your Microsoft account and your work or school 
	> account share the same email address.  Although both identities use the same email address, 
	> they're still separate identities with different profiles, security settings, and permissions.

0.	Go to **Subscriptions** tab.

> [!NOTE]   
> As you customize a workflow, all Azure Codex projects that reference the inherited process that you're customizing will automatically update to reflect the customized workflow states. For this reason, we recommend that you create a test process and test project when you have a number of customizations to make in order to test the customizations prior to rolling them out to your organization. To learn more, see [Create and manage inherited processes](/vsts/settings/work/manage-process.md).

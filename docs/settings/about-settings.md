# About project and account settings 

Overview of what you can manage under the **Settings** context.   

From the administrative or Settings context, you configure resources that support your teams. The three levels which you can configure are the team level, project level, and account or collection level. 

You must be a member of the listed administrator group or role to configure resources at the levels indicated. To learn more about security groups and roles, see XXX. 


## Team level  

To configure team resources, you must be a member of the [team administrator role](../work/scale/add-team-administrator.md) for the team, or a member of the Project Administrators or Project Collection Administrators groups.

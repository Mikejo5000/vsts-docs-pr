# About READMEs and Wiki

**VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017**


## READMEs

To share information with your team, you can create README files for a repository, or create and add pages to a team project Wiki. Wiki files are managed in a wiki repository. You can edit these files using Markdown format.  

You can define a README file, or multiple files, for each repo or team project. 

Write your readme in [Markdown](../collaborate/markdown-guidance.md) instead of plain text. Markdown makes it easy to format text, include images, and link as needed to additional documentation from your readme.

Here are some great readmes that use this format and speak to all three audiences, for reference and inspiration:

- [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/Home)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
- [Chakra Core](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore)

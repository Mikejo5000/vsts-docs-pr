#User-focused features

**Team Services | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015.1**

With user-focused features, you gain quick access to the work you're most interested in. The features show-cased below are available from Team Services and the web portal for TFS. They focus on features supported through the web portal. Most of these features operate based on your logged-in user account.

<blockquote style="font-size: 13px"><b>Feature availability: </b>The following features are available from Team Services or from the web portal of the listed on-premises TFS version or a later version. Those not annotated are available from all platforms and versions. Visit the [Visual Studio Downloads](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) page to get the latest TFS update. </blockquote>

>[!NOTE]  
>If you work in Team Services or TFS 2017.1, you can also use your account hub to view and quickly navigate to teams, team projects, branches, work items, pull requests and other objects that are relevant to you. For details, see [Work effectively from your account hub](account-home-pages.md).   


## Code development  

Your selected repository and branch persists from session to session. 

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b>Code development features are supported from Team Services or the web portal for TFS 2015.2 or later version.   

<a id="my-code-branches">  </a>

### View changes made to your published branches  

From the **Code>Branches>Mine** page, you can quickly access all branches you've published. 

<img src="../git/_img/branches/branches_tree_view.png" alt="Web portal, View your branches in a tree view when using a path separator in the branch names" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" /> 

Also, you can add branch folders to your favorites and they'll show up on your **Mine** page. For details, see [Manage branches, Mark favorites](../git/manage-your-branches.md#mark-favorites). 
  
<img src="../git/_img/branches/branches_favorites.png" alt="Web portal, Set favorites in your branches to show them in the Mine view" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />

<a id="initiate-pr">  </a>
### Complete pull request prompt after publishing a branch 

When you publish or update a feature branch in your Git repo, you will get a prompt asking if would like to create a pull request from the **Code** hub.

![Team Services, create Pull Request through pushed branch in Team Services](../git/_img/pull-requests/create_pr_from_push.png)

Select the **New pull request** link to go to a page where you will enter your pull request details and create the pull request. See [Review code with pull requests](../git/pull-requests.md) for details. 

### View pull requests you initiated 
 
<a id="my-prs">  </a>

From the **Code>Pull Request>Mine** page, you can quickly access all branches you've published. 

<img src="_img/user-cf-pull-requests-mine.png" alt="Team Services, Code, PUll Requests, Mine page" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />

<a id="mention-wit-id">  </a>
### Link to recently viewed work items 

<blockquote style="font-size: 13px"><b>Feature availability: </b>The **#ID** special control for pull requests is supported from Team Services or the web portal for TFS 2015.1 or later version.   </blockquote>  

When leaving a code comment in a pull request, you can type **#** to trigger the **#ID** work item picker. The picker displays a list of 50 work items that you have recently modified or that are assigned to you. 

<img src="../work/productivity/_img/ALM_PRD_ID_PR.png" alt="Pull request comment area, type # to invoke work item control" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />    

For details, see [Productivity tips, Use the #ID control to link to work items](../work/productivity/productivity-tips.md#mention-wit-id)

In a similar manner to the #ID field for a pull request, you can enter #ID within a work item Discussion, a commit, or a changeset or shelveset. You'll receive the same work item picker that displays a list of 50 work items that you have recently modified or that are assigned to you.   

<a id="follow-pr">  </a>
### Tag pull requests you want to follow  

>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b>The **Follow** feature for pull requests is supported from Team Services or the web portal for TFS 2017.1 or later versions. For on-premises TFS, [you must configure an SMTP sever](../setup-admin/tfs/admin/setup-customize-alerts.md) in order for team members to receive notifications. 

To track the progress of a single pull request, click the ![Follow icon](../work/_img/icons/follow-icon.png) option from the context menu. To stop following changes, open the PR context menu and click the ![Following icon](../work/_img/icons/following-icon.png) icon. For details, see [Follow a work item or pull request](../collaborate/follow-work-items.md).  

<img src="../work/track/_img/follow-pull-request.png" alt="Pull Request, context menu, Follow icon option" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />  

 

## Track work  

Your selected backlog or board persists from session to session.   

Several features support your ability to track work assigned to you or work you want to stay up-to-date as changes are made. In addition to the features described in this section, see also [Personal alerts](#alerts) later in this topic. 

<a id="follow">  </a>
### Tag work items you want to follow  
>[!NOTE]  
><b>Feature availability: </b>The **Follow** feature is supported from Team Services or the web portal for TFS 2017 or later version. For on-premises TFS, [you must configure an SMTP sever](../setup-admin/tfs/admin/setup-customize-alerts.md) in order for team members to receive notifications.    

Click the ![Follow icon](../work/_img/icons/follow-icon.png) icon from any work item to get notified when changes are made to the work item or people add to the discussion. To stop following changes, click the ![Following icon](../work/_img/icons/following-icon.png) icon. For details, see [Follow a work item or pull request](../collaborate/follow-work-items.md).  

<img src="../work/backlogs/_img/follow-work-item.png" alt="Team Services Work item form, Follow icon control" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />  


<a id="my-queries-favorites">  </a>
### Predefined queries, My queries, and My favorites 
<a id="assigned-to-me">  </a>
From the **Work>Queries** page you'll find several features that help you focus on work assigned to you or work you're following. The Assigned to me query lists all work that is currently assigned to you using the **@Me** macro. You can modify this query as needed. The Followed work items query supports managing the work items you've tagged to follow. To learn more about queries, see [Use the query editor to list and manage queries](../work/track/using-queries.md).

In addition, you can save queries to your **My Queries** folder which only you'll have access, or drag defined queries to your **My favorites** folder. 

<img src="_img/user-cf-queries.png" alt="Team Services, Work, Queries page" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />  


<a id="backlog-board-filters">  </a>
### Backlog and board filters 

<blockquote style="font-size: 13px"><b>Feature availability: </b>Kaban field filters are supported from Team Services or the web portal for TFS 2017 or later version.   </blockquote>


<a id="kanban-board">  </a>
From a Kanban board, you can [filter based on your name](../work/kanban/filter-kanban-board.md#field-filter) to focus on those items assigned to you. 

<img src="_img/user-cf-filter-by-name-kanban-board.png" alt="Kanban board, Filter on logged in user" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />  


<a id="task-board">  </a>

From the sprint task board, you can focus on the work you've completed and your remaining work by [filtering on your name](../work/scrum/task-board.md#show-individual-progress).

<img src="../work/scrum/_img/ALM_TB_GRP_Items_CC.png" alt="Sprint task board, Group by Backlog items, show Christie Church team member" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />  

<a id="dashboard-widgets">  </a>
## Dashboard widgets 
<a id="assigned-to-me-widget">  </a>

<blockquote style="font-size: 13px"><b>Feature availability: </b>The **Assigned to me** widget is supported from Team Services or the web portal for TFS 2017 or later version.   </blockquote>

There are two widgets you can add to the dashboard to focus on your work. The first is the Assigned to me widget, which works off a predefined query (different from the Assigned to me query described in the previous section).   

![Assigned to me widget](_img/web-portal-assigned-to-me-widget.png)
<a id="my-pr-widget">  </a>

<blockquote style="font-size: 13px"><b>Feature availability: </b>The **Pull Request** widget is supported from Team Services or the web portal for TFS 2015.2 or later version. </blockquote>

The second widget is the Pull Requests widget which can be configured to show just those pull requests assigned to the logged in user or requested by the logged in user. To learn more about dashboards and widgets, see [Dashboards](../report/dashboards.md) and the[ Widget catalog](../report/widget-catalog.md). to learn about pull requests, see [View and create pull requests](../git/pull-requests.md). 

<img src="_img/user-cf-pull-request-widget.png" alt="Pull Request widget, configured to show assigned to me" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" /> 


<a id="my-builds">  </a>
## DevOps: Build, Test, Release

<blockquote style="font-size: 13px"><b>Feature availability: </b>The following feature is currently supported only from Team Services.   </blockquote>

From the **Build>Definitions>Mine** page, you can quickly view all builds you've selected as a favorite, have been set as a team favorite, or builds of code that you've checked in. To learn more, see  [2016 Team Foundation Build release notes](../build/news/2016.md#august-19).

<img src="_img/user-cf-build-mine.png" alt="Team Services, Code, Pull Requests, Mine page" style="border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;" />


<a id="alerts">  </a>
## Personal notifications or alerts 

With notifications or alerts, you can personalize the email notifications you receive based on changes made to work items, pushed commits, pull request activity, completion of builds, and more.

For Team Services and TFS 2017.1 and later versions, you [manage  your personal notifications](../collaborate/manage-personal-notifications.md). For TFS 2017 and earlier versions, you [manage your personal alerts](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md).

The functionality is similar whether you are managing notifications or alerts, as indicated in the following tables. The main differences are changes made to the user interface. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For on-premises TFS, [you must configure an SMTP sever](../setup-admin/tfs/admin/setup-customize-alerts.md) in order for team members to receive notifications.

A feed is a container for packages.
You consume and publish packages through a particular feed.

1. Navigate to the **Packages** hub in the **Build & Release** hub group:

   ![Go to Packages hub](_img/goto-feed-hub.png)

   >If you don't see the Packages hub, ask your account owner to install the [Package Management extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.feed) from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](../../marketplace/install-vsts-extension.md).

1. Click the dropdown in the top left and select **New feed**:

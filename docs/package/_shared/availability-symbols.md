> [!NOTE]
> A symbol server is available with Azure Artifacts in **Azure DevOps Services** and works best with **Visual Studio 2017 Update 4 or later**. **Team Foundation Server** users and users without the Azure Artifacts extension can publish symbols to a file share using a [build task](/vsts/pipelines/tasks/build/index-sources-publish-symbols).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use symbol server, ensure you've [installed Azure Artifacts](../install.md) and assigned a license for each user that will consume symbols.

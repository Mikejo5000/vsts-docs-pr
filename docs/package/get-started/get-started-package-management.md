# Azure DevOps XXX New User Orientation

## What is Azure DevOps XXX?

Azure DevOps XXX is a service that you can use to store your NuGet, npm, and Maven packages alongside all of your other VSTS assets. You can use XXX to both create and consume packages both in VSTS or TFS and other package repositories such as NuGet.org or npmjs.com.

With Azure DevOps XXX, you can:

* Store your packages alongside your source code, builds, and releases
* Create packages as part of your build process
* Consume packages from public and internal sources as part of your build process
* Organize your packages into "feeds" and control who can access them

## Does XXX work with my languages and tools?

Currently, XXX supports consumption and creation of **NuGet, npm, and Maven** packages.

Some XXX services are only compatible with specific versions of TFS. Check out the table below to see compatibility.

# Improve your pull request descriptions with pull request templates

#### VSTS 

A good pull request description can help reviewers be effective when reviewing pull requests. Pull request templates can help your pull request creators to create good pull request descriptions that meet your organization's standards.

A pull request template is a markdown file located in a designated folder. Multiple pull request templates can be present.

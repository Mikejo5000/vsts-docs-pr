# Build variables

**VSTS | TFS 2017 | TFS 2015 | [Previous versions (XAML builds)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh850448%28v=vs.120%29.aspx)**

Variables give you a convenient way to get key bits of data into various parts of your build process.

| Use | User-defined  | Predefined, all scopes | Predefined, agent scope | Format | Examples and more information |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| As arguments to build steps | Yes | Yes | Yes | `$(Build.DefinitionName)` | [Command line](../../../tasks/utility/command-line.md), [Copy files](../../../tasks/utility/copy-files.md) |
| Apply a version control label during the build process | Yes | Yes | No | `$(Build.DefinitionName)` | [Repository tab](repository.md) (Git and Team Foundation version control **Label format**) |
| Customize the build number | Yes | Yes | No  | `$(Build.DefinitionName)` | [Build number format options](options.md) |
| Environment variable in Windows batch scripts| Yes | Yes | Yes | `%BUILD_DEFINITIONNAME%` | [Batch script ](../../../tasks/utility/batch-script.md#example) |
| Environment variable in PowerShell scripts | Yes | Yes | Yes | `$env:BUILD_DEFINITIONNAME` | [PowerShell script](../../../actions/scripts/powershell.md) |
| Environment variable in Shell scripts | Yes | Yes | Yes | `$BUILD_DEFINITIONNAME` | [Shell script](../../../tasks/utility/shell-script.md#example) |


## User-defined variables

Variables are a great way to store and share key bits of data in your build definition. Some build templates automatically define some variables for you.

For example, when you [create a new .NET app build](../../../apps/windows/dot-net.md), `BuildConfiguration` and `BuildPlatform` are automatically defined for you.

User-defined variables are formatted differently in different contexts. See above table.

### Secret Variables

We recommend that you make the variable ![Secret](_img/variables/secret-variable-icon.png)
**Secret** if it contains a password, keys, or some other kind of data that you need to avoid exposing.

**VSTS**

![Keep password secret](_img/variables/keep-password-secret-neweditor.png)

**Team Foundation Server (TFS) 2017 Update 1 and older**

![Keep password secret](_img/variables/keep-password-secret.png)

Secret variables are:

* Encrypted at rest with a 2048-bit RSA key.

* Not returned back to the client. They are automatically masked out of any log output from the build or release.  

* Not decrypted into environment variables. So scripts and programs run by your build steps are not given access by default.

* Decrypted for access by your build steps. So you can use them in password arguments and also pass them explicitly into a script or a program from your build step (for example as `$(password)`).


### Allow at queue time

Select this check box if you want to enable your team to modify the value when they manually queue a build.

[!INCLUDE [include](../../../concepts/definitions/_shared/set-variables-in-scripts.md)]

## Control variables

| Variable Name | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Build.Clean | Modifies how the build agent cleans things up. See [Source repositories](repository.md). |
| System.Debug | If you need more detailed logs to debug build problems, define and set it to `true`. |

## Environment variables

You can pass environment variables of the build machine into build steps. For example, on the [Build tab](../../../tasks/index.md) of a build definition, add this step:

| Task | Arguments |
| ---- | --------- |
| ![](../../../tasks/utility/_img/command-line.png) **Utility: Command Line** | Tool: `echo`<br />Arguments: `$(PATH)` |

> [!NOTE]
> If you have defined the a variable of the same name (for example `PATH`) on the [variables tab](variables.md), then your value overrides the environment variable when you use it as shown above.

## Predefined variables

## Q&A
<!-- BEGINSECTION class="md-qanda" -->


### What are the predefined Release Management variables?

[Default release management variables](../../../concepts/definitions/release/variables.md#default-variables)


<a name="identity_values"></a>
### How are the identity variables set?

The value depends on what caused the build.

| If the build is triggered... | Then the Build.QueuedBy and Build.QueuedById values are based on... | Then the Build.RequestedFor and Build.RequestedForId values are based on... |
| --- | --- | ---|
| In Git or TFVC by the [Continuous integration (CI) triggers](triggers.md) | The system identity, for example: `[DefaultCollection]\Project Collection Service Accounts` | The person who pushed or checked in the changes. |
| In Git or by a [branch policy build](../../../../git/branch-policies.md#require-the-pull-request-to-build). | The system identity, for example: `[DefaultCollection]\Project Collection Service Accounts` | The person who checked in the changes. |
| In TFVC by a [gated check-in trigger](triggers.md) | The person who checked in the changes. | The person who checked in the changes. |
| In Git or TFVC by the [Scheduled triggers](triggers.md) | The system identity, for example: `[DefaultCollection]\Project Collection Service Accounts` | The system identity, for example: `[DefaultCollection]\Project Collection Service Accounts` |
| Because you clicked the **Queue build** button | You | You |

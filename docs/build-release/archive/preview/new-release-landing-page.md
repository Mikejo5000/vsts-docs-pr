# New release landing page

A new and fully redesigned user experience is available for release landing page in VSTS.
To use this page, you simply need to switch it on using one of the on-screen prompts,
or from the [user profile **Previews** panel](../../../collaborate/preview-features.md#enable-features-for-your-use).

## Active tab

The **Active** tab shows a list of release definitions, and contains links to create or import a definition, edit the selected definition, and create a release. 

![](_img/releases-page/1.png)

Use the drop-down menu to create a draft release, or to delete, clone, or export the selected release definition. 

![](_img/releases-page/2.png)

Search for definitions if you have many in your list, or make it easy to select regularly used definitions by adding them to your list of favorites...

![](_img/releases-page/3.png)

... or use the filter options to show the required subset of definitions. 

![](_img/releases-page/4.png)

Use the drop-down menu to open, abandon, or delete a release, or to retain it indefinitely.

##All definitions tab

The **All definitions** tab shows all your release definitions as a folder tree. Use the drop-down menu to create a release or work with the selected definition.

![](_img/releases-page/6.png)

Use the **Environment summary** link in the menu to see a more detailed view of the status and history of releases for any of the environments in the definition.

![](_img/releases-page/7.png)

Because this is currently a preview, expect to see changes to the features and layout as development of the page continues.

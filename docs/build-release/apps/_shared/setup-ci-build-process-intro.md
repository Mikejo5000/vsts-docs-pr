The simplest way to define your build process is to use an **YAML** file and to check in that file at the root of your repository. The advantage of this approach is that your build process is managed as code and it follows the same branch structure as the rest of your application code. Another way to define your build process is to use the build definition **web editor** in VSTS. This provides a more visual approach to creating your build process.

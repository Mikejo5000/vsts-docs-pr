### MSBuild Architecture

Select either MSBuild x86 or MSBuild x64.

> [!TIP]
>
> Because Visual Studio runs as a 32-bit application, you could experience problems when your build is processed by a build agent that is running the 64-bit version of Team Foundation Build Service. By selecting MSBuild x86, you might resolve these kinds of problems.

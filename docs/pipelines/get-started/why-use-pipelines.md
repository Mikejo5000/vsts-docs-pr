# Why Use Azure DevOps Pipelines?

Azure DevOps Pipelines is the quickest, easiest, and safest way to automate building your projects and making them available to users.

## The importance of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines in software development

Some of the benefits of using CI and CD pipelines:

| Continuous Integration (CI)                    |  Continous Delivery (CD)                       |
| -----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Increase code coverage                         | Automatically deploy code to production        |
| Build stuff faster by splitting test and build | Ensure deployment targets have latest code     |
| Automatically ensure you don't ship broken code|
| Run tests continually                          |

## Why use Azure DevOps Pipelines for CI and CD

* Works with any language or platform
* Deploy to different types of targets at the same time
* Best integration experience for deploying to Azure
* Build on Windows, Linux, or Mac machines
* Great integration for GitHub
* Great offer for OSS repos

## What can Pipelines do?

> **ELBATK NOTE**: AKA, what problems do I have that I can solve with Pipelines

### Automate building and testing of your project to ensure it stays up to date and error-free

### Automate the deployment of your built and tested project to numerous targets such as an app store, or a package management respository

### Automate packaging of your project to make the newest version available to all users

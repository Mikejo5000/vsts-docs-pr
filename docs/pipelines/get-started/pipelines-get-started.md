# Getting started with Azure DevOps Pipelines

## What is Azure DevOps Pipelines?

Azure DevOps Pipelines is a cloud service that you can use to automatically build and test your code project and make it available to other users. It works with just about any language or project type.

Pipelines combines both **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** to constantly and consistently test and build your code and ship it to any target. 

If you're not sure if Pipelines is right for your needs, read [Why Use Azure DevOps Pipelines?](why-use-pipelines.md).

## Does Pipelines work with my language and tools?

### Languages

You can use practically any language with Azure DevOps Pipelines, including **Java, C#, C++, Python, Go, and Ruby.**

### Version control systems

The starting point for using CI and CD practices for your applications is to have your source code in a version control system. Pipelines supports two forms of version control: **Git and Team Foundation Version Control.**

### Application types

You can use Azure DevOps Pipelines with most application types, including **.NET, Java, Node, Android, Xcode, and C++.**

### Deployment targets

Azure DevOps Pipelines can be used to deploy your code to multiple targets, such as **virtual machines, containers, on-premises and cloud platforms, PaaS services.**

### Package formats

If your goal is to produce packages that can be consumed by others, you can publish **NuGet, npm, or Maven packages** to the built-in package management repository in VSTS or any other package management repository of your choice.

## What do I need to use Pipelines?

To use Azure DevOps Pipelines, you'll need the following:

* A VSTS or TFS account
* Have your source code stored in a version control system (Git or TFVC)

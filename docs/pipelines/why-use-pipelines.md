# Why Use Azure DevOps Pipelines?

Azure DevOps Pipelines is the quickest, easiest, and safest way to automate building your projects and making them available to users.

## What can Pipelines do?

Maybe a list or a table that has things like:

* Automate building of your project to ensure it stays up to date and error-free
* Automate packaging of your project to make the newest version available to all users
* etc.

AKA, what problems do I have that I can solve with Pipelines

## Pipelines example scenarios

### App developer that wants to push weekly updates

### .NET developer that ships their code via packages

### etc.

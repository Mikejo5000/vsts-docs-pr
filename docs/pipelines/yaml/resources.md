# YAML getting started - Resources

Resources enable the definition of various items which are to be produced or consumed
by the defining pipeline. Every resource must specify an `alias`, which is how the resource
is referenced throughout the pipeline. In general the resource `alias` should be kept short
and treated like a variable name, as resources may utilize the value for folder creation.

## Containers

```yaml
resources:
  containers:
  # Required. Specifies the alias by which this resource is known within the pipeline
  - container: string 
    
    # Required. Specifies the docker image name
    image: string 

    # Optional. Specifies the name of the service endpoint used to connect to the docker registry
    endpoint: string 

    # Optional. Specifies any extra options you want to add for container startup
    options: string 
    
    # Optional. Specifies whether the image is locally built (not pulled from the docker registry)
    localImage: true | false 
    
    # Optional. Specifies a dictionary of environment variables added during container creation
    env:
      { string: string } 
```

## Repositories

The `alias` and `type` proprerties are the only shared constructs among all repository types. 

```yaml
# File: .vsts-ci.yml

resources:
  repositories:
    # Required: Specifies the alias by which this resource is known within the pipeline
  - repository: string
  
    # Required: Specifies the type of repository
    type: git | github
```

### Git Repositories

#### Git

`git` refers to Git repositories in VSTS. Currently only repositories located within the same project are allowed.

```yaml
resources:
  repositories:
  - repository: alias
    type: git

    # Required: Specifies the name of the repository in the project
    name: string
    
    # Optional: Specifies the default ref used to resolve the version 
    # Default: refs/heads/master
    ref: string
```

#### GitHub

```yaml
resources:
  repositories:
  - repository: alias
    type: github
    
    # Required: Specifies the name of the service endpoint used to connect to github
    endpoint: string

    # Required: Specifies the name of the repository. For example, user/repo or organization/repo.
    name: string
    
    # Optional: Specifies the default ref used to resolve the version
    # Default: refs/heads/master
    ref: string    
```

# YAML getting started - Pipeline overview

## Pipeline

A pipeline contains phases. Phases contain steps.

## Stages

Stages provide a logical boundary within the pipeline.

The stage boundary allows:
- Manual checkpoints or approvals between stages
- Reporting on high level results (email notifications, build badges) -->

## Phases

A phase is a group of steps, and is assigned to a specific target.

For example, when a phase targets an agent pool, the phase will be assigned to one of the agents running within the pool.

## Steps

Steps are the individual units of execution within a phase. For example, run a script.

# YAML getting started - Create a definition

## When using a Git repo in your VSTS team project

Push a YAML file `.vsts-ci.yml` to the root directory of your repository. A definition
`<REPO_NAME>/<REPO_NAME> CI` will be created, and a CI build will be triggered.

Note, the definition will only be created if whoever pushes the branch update has
permission to create a definition.

Optionally a new YAML definition can be created from the web UI. You can choose any YAML
file within your repository.

## When using a Git repo in GitHub

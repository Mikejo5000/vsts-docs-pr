# Integrate third party services like Slack or Microsoft Teams

<b>VSTS | TFS 2018 | TFS 2017.1 | [Previous versions](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md)</b> 

> [!NOTE]  
> This topic applies to VSTS, TFS 2017 Update 1, and later versions. If you work from an on-premises TFS 2017 or ealier versions, see [Set alerts, get notified when changes occur](../work/track/alerts-and-notifications.md). For on-premises TFS, [you must configure an SMTP server](/tfs/server/admin/setup-customize-alerts) in order for team members to see the Notifications option from their organization menu and to receive notifications.

Integrate with your favorite services by notifying them when events happen in VSTS. Here are a few examples:
* [Send VSTS notifications to a Slack channel](../service-hooks/services/slack.md)
* [Send VSTS notifications to a Microsoft Teams channel](../service-hooks/services/teams.md)
* [Send VSTS notifications to a Trello board](../service-hooks/services/trello.md)
* [Send VSTS notifications to a HipChat room](../service-hooks/services/hipchat.md)
* [Send VSTS notifications to Azure Service Bus](../service-hooks/services/azure-service-bus.md)

Or, integrate with any endpoint by [Sending VSTS notifications to a generic WebHook](../service-hooks/services/webhooks.md). Click [here](../service-hooks/index.md) to learn about all the integration options.

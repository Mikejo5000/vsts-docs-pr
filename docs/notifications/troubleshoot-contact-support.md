# Contacting support

If you've reviewed the troubleshooting sections and can't resolve your issue you might want to open a free support ticket.  When contacting support regarding notification issues, it's good to have answers to the following questions.

1. When did you start noticing the problem?
1. What emails are you not getting that you expect?
1. Are you getting other types of emails?
1. Is it just you or are others also not getting emails they expect?
1. Can you supply ids such as work item, build, or pull request ids with recent events?

It's best to have a recent event for the email or service hook notification in question.  Full details about the event and notification delivery are retained for a few days and are beneficial when resolving a notification issue. You might be asked to reproduce the issue with a new event and provide the time/date and ids (build, pull request, etc) associated with the event.

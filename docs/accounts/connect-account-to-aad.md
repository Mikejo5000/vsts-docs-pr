#	Connect VSTS account to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

**VSTS**

If your VSTS account was created with a Microsoft account, 
you can connect your VSTS account to your 
organization's directory (tenant) in 
[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/). 
You can then sign in to VSTS with the same username 
and password that you use with these Microsoft services. 
You can also enforce policies for accessing 
your team's critical resources and key assets.

For more information, see the [conceptual overview](access-with-azure-ad.md) for using Azure AD with VSTS.

> [!NOTE]
> VSTS will support connecting your VSTS account to an Azure directory to the Azure portal in a few weeks.  In the meantime, 
> you can open a [support case](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=864080) for someone to walk you through the process.
